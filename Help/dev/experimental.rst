CMake Experimental Features Guide
*********************************

The following is a guide to CMake experimental features that are
under development and not yet included in official documentation.
See documentation on `CMake Development`_ for more information.

C++20 Module Dependencies
=========================

The Ninja generator has experimental infrastructure supporting C++20 module
dependency scanning.  This is similar to the Fortran modules support, but
relies on external tools to scan C++20 translation units for module
dependencies.  The approach is described by Kitware's `D1483r1`_ paper.

The ``CMAKE_EXPERIMENTAL_CXX_MODULE_DYNDEP`` variable can be set to ``1``
in order to activate this undocumented experimental infrastructure.  This
is **intended to make the functionality available to compiler writers** so
they can use it to develop and test their dependency scanning tool.
The ``CMAKE_EXPERIMENTAL_CXX_SCANDEP_SOURCE`` variable must also be set
to tell CMake how to invoke the C++20 module dependency scanning tool.

For example, add code like the following to a test project:

.. code-block:: cmake

  set(CMAKE_EXPERIMENTAL_CXX_MODULE_DYNDEP 1)
  string(CONCAT CMAKE_EXPERIMENTAL_CXX_SCANDEP_SOURCE
    "<CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER> <DEFINES> <INCLUDES> <FLAGS> <SOURCE>"
    " -MT <DYNDEP_FILE> -MD -MF <DEP_FILE>"
    " ${flags_to_scan_deps} -fdep-file=<DYNDEP_FILE> -fdep-output=<OBJECT>"
    )

The tool specified by ``CMAKE_EXPERIMENTAL_CXX_SCANDEP_SOURCE`` is
expected to process the translation unit, write preprocessor dependencies
to the file specified by the ``<DEP_FILE>`` placeholder, and write module
dependencies to the file specified by the ``<DYNDEP_FILE>`` placeholder.

The module dependencies should be written in the format described
by the `P1689r3`_ paper.

Compiler writers may try out their scanning functionality using
the `cxx-modules-sandbox`_ test project, modified to set variables
as above for their compiler.

For compilers that generate module maps, tell CMake as follows:

.. code-block:: cmake

  set(CMAKE_EXPERIMENTAL_CXX_MODULE_MAP_FORMAT "gcc")
  set(CMAKE_EXPERIMENTAL_CXX_MODULE_MAP_FLAG
    "${compiler_flags_for_module_map} -fmodule-mapper=<MODULE_MAP_FILE>")

Currently, the only supported format is ``gcc``.  The format is described in
the GCC documentation, but the relevant section for the purposes of CMake is:

    A mapping file consisting of space-separated module-name, filename
    pairs, one per line.  Only the mappings for the direct imports and any
    module export name need be provided.  If other mappings are provided,
    they override those stored in any imported CMI files.  A repository
    root may be specified in the mapping file by using ``$root`` as the
    module name in the first active line.
