.. versionadded:: 3.20

Source file extensions must be explicit.

In CMake 3.19 and below, if a source file could not be found by the name
specified, it would append a list of known extensions to the name to see if
the file with the extension could be found. For example, this would allow the
user to run:

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_executable(exe main)

and put ``main.c`` in the executable without specifying the extension.

Starting in CMake 3.20, CMake prefers all source files to have their extensions
explicitly listed:

.. code-block:: cmake

  add_executable(exe main.c)

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to implicitly append known extensions
to source files if they can't be found. The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is
to not append known extensions and require them to be explicit.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.20.  CMake version |release|
warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior. Use the
:command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
