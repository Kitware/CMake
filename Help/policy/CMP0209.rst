Verify interface header sets checks executables without exports.

When :prop_tgt:`VERIFY_INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS` is set to true on an executable
target, CMake 4.2 and below would only perform those checks if the target's
:prop_tgt:`ENABLE_EXPORTS` property was true.  The reasoning behind this
exclusion was that no other target could consume the headers of an executable
target if that executable target didn't export symbols.  Since then, other
use cases have emerged for verifying header file sets where exporting symbols
is no longer a requirement.  Therefore, CMake 4.3 and above prefer to verify
interface file sets of executable targets regardless of whether they export
symbols or not.

The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy only verifies interface file sets of an
executable target if its :prop_tgt:`ENABLE_EXPORTS` property is set to true.
The ``NEW`` behavior always verifies interface file sets of an executable
target when :prop_tgt:`VERIFY_INTERFACE_HEADER_SETS` is set to true.
