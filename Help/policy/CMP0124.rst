.. versionadded:: 3.21

The loop variables created by :command:`foreach` command have now their scope
restricted to the loop scope.

Starting with CMake 3.21, the :command:`foreach` command ensures that the loop
variables have their scope restricted to the loop scope.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy let the loop variables to exist, with an
empty value, in the outer scope of loop scope.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.21. Use the
:command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
Unlike many policies, CMake version |release| does *not* warn when the policy
is not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior.
