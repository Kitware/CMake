.. versionadded:: 3.21

:module:`UseSWIG` use library name conventions for ``CSharp`` language.

Starting with CMake 3.21, :module:`UseSWIG` generates now a library using
default naming conventions. This policy provides compatibility with projects
that expect the legacy behavior.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.21.  CMake version
|release| warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.
Use the :command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly.
