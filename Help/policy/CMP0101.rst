.. versionadded:: 3.17

:command:`target_compile_options` now always honors the ``BEFORE`` keyword.

In CMake 3.16 and below, the :command:`target_compile_options` command
ignores the ``BEFORE`` keyword when inserting items into the
:prop_tgt:`COMPILE_OPTIONS` target property (``PRIVATE`` and ``PUBLIC``
items).  CMake 3.17 and later honors the ``BEFORE`` keyword in all cases.
This policy provides compatibility for projects that have not been updated
to expect the new behavior.

The behavior of inserting items into the :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS`
target property (``PUBLIC`` and ``INTERFACE`` items) is not affected by this
policy.  The ``BEFORE`` keyword has always been honored when adding items to
:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS`.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to not honor the ``BEFORE`` keyword
when inserting into the :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_OPTIONS` property.
The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to honor the ``BEFORE`` keyword in
all cases.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.17.  Use the
:command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
Unlike many policies, CMake version |release| does *not* warn
when this policy is not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior.
