:command:`target_link_libraries` reports error if its only argument
is not a target.

In CMake 2.8.2 and lower the :command:`target_link_libraries` command silently
ignored if it was called with only one argument, and this argument
wasn't a valid target.  In CMake 2.8.3 and above it reports an error
in this case.
