:command:`file(CREATE_LINK)` with ``COPY_ON_ERROR`` copies directory content.

The :command:`file(CREATE_LINK)` command's ``COPY_ON_ERROR`` option copies
the source file to the destination as a fallback if linking it fails.
If the source is a directory, CMake 4.2 and below create the destination
directory but do not copy its contents.  CMake 4.3 and above prefer to
copy the directory contents too.  This policy provides compatibility with
projects that have not been updated to expect the contents to be copied.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to create the destination directory
without copying contents.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy to create
the destination directory and copy contents from the source directory.
