.. versionadded:: 4.3

:variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_LINK_FLAGS` adds link flags to all target types.

In CMake 4.2 and below, :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_LINK_FLAGS` held flags
relevant to target creation and applied when linking executables only. It was
undocumented and originally intended for internal use only, but still
available for projects and users to set in order to control linking behavior.

CMake 4.3 and above repurpose this variable to add per-language link flags for
all target types that link (executables, shared libraries, and module
libraries).

This policy provides compatibility with projects that relied on this variable
and have not been updated to be aware of the change.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to apply
:variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_LINK_FLAGS` to invocations of the compiler which drive
linking for executables only. The ``NEW`` behavior is to apply the flags to
all target types.
