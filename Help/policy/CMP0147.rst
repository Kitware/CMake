.. versionadded:: 3.27

:ref:`Visual Studio Generators` build custom commands in parallel.

Visual Studio 15.8 (2017) and newer support building custom commands in
parallel.  CMake 3.27 and above prefer to enable this behavior by adding
a ``BuildInParallel`` setting to custom commands in ``.vcxproj`` files.
This policy provides compatibility for projects that have not been updated
to expect this, e.g., because their custom commands were accidentally
relying on serial execution by MSBuild.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to not add ``BuildInParallel``.
The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to add ``BuildInParallel`` for
VS 15.8 and newer.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.27.  Use the
:command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
Unlike many policies, CMake version |release| does *not* warn
when this policy is not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior.
