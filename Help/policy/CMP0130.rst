.. versionadded:: 3.24

:command:`while` diagnoses condition evaluation errors.

CMake 3.23 and below accidentally tolerated errors encountered while
evaluating the condition passed to the :command:`while` command
(but not the :command:`if` command).  For example, the code

.. code-block:: cmake

  set(paren "(")
  while(${paren})
  endwhile()

creates an unbalanced parenthesis during condition evaluation.

CMake 3.24 and above prefer to diagnose such errors.  This policy
provides compatibility for projects that have not been updated to
fix their condition errors.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore errors in
:command:`while` conditions.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this
policy is to diagnose errors in :command:`while` conditions.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.24.  CMake version |release|
warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use the
:command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
