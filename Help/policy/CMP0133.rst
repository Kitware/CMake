.. versionadded:: 3.24

The :module:`CPack` module disables SLA by default in the
:cpack_gen:`CPack DragNDrop Generator`.

The :cpack_gen:`CPack DragNDrop Generator` in CMake 3.22 and below attach a
Software License Agreement (SLA) to ``.dmg`` files using the file specified
by :variable:`CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE`, if set to a non-default value.
macOS 12.0 deprecated the tools used to do this, so CMake 3.23 added
the :variable:`CPACK_DMG_SLA_USE_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE` option to
control the behavior.  CMake 3.23 enables that option by default for
compatibility with older versions. CMake 3.24 and above prefer to *not*
enable the :variable:`CPACK_DMG_SLA_USE_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE` option by
default. This policy provides compatibility with projects that have not
been updated to account for the lack of a SLA in their ``.dmg`` packages.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to enable
:variable:`CPACK_DMG_SLA_USE_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE` by default.
The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to not enable it by default.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.24.  Use the
:command:`cmake_policy` command to set this policy to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly. Unlike many policies, CMake version |release| does *not* warn
by default when this policy is not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior.
See documentation of the
:variable:`CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0133 <CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP<NNNN>>`
variable to control the warning.
