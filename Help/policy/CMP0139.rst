.. versionadded:: 3.24

The :command:`if` command supports path comparisons using ``PATH_EQUAL``
operator.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore the ``PATH_EQUAL`` operator.
The ``NEW`` behavior is to interpret the ``PATH_EQUAL`` operator.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.24.
CMake version |release| warns when the policy is not set and uses
``OLD`` behavior.  Use the :command:`cmake_policy` command to set
it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
