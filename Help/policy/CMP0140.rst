.. versionadded:: 3.25

The :command:`return` command checks its parameters.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore any parameters given to the
command.
The ``NEW`` behavior is to check the validity of the parameters.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.25.
CMake version |release| warns when the policy is not set and uses
``OLD`` behavior.  Use the :command:`cmake_policy` command to set
it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
