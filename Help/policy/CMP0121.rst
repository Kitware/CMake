.. versionadded:: 3.21

The :command:`list` command now detects invalid indices.

Prior to CMake version 3.21, the :command:`list` command's ``GET``,
``INSERT``, ``SUBLIST``, and ``REMOVE_AT`` subcommands did not detect invalid
index arguments.

The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is for invalid indices to be treated as
their integer value (if any) at the start of the string. For example,
``2good4you`` is a ``2`` and ``not_an_integer`` is a ``0``. The ``NEW``
behavior is for invalid indices to trigger an error.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.21.  CMake version |release|
warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior. Use the
:command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
