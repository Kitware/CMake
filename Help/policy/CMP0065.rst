CMP0065
-------

Restrict the addition of CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_LINK_<LANG>_FLAGS
to executable targets only when the :prop_tgt:`ENABLE_EXPORTS`
target property is turned on.

The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is to always use the additional link
flags when linking executables regardless of the value of the
:prop_tgt:`ENABLE_EXPORTS` target property.

The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to only use the additional link
flags when linking executables if the :prop_tgt:`ENABLE_EXPORTS` target
property is set to ``True``.
