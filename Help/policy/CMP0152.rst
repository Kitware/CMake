:command:`file(REAL_PATH)` resolves symlinks before collapsing ../ components.

In CMake 3.27 and below, :command:`file(REAL_PATH)` collapsed any ``../``
components in a path before resolving symlinks.  This produced incorrect
results when the ``../`` collapsed away a symlink.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to collapse ``../`` components before
resolving symlinks.
The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to resolve all symlinks before
collapsing ``../`` components.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.28.  Use the
:command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
