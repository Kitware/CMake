CMP0206
-------

.. versionadded:: 4.3

The :cpack_gen:`CPack Archive Generator` defaults to UID 0 and GID 0.

In CMake 4.2 and below, the :cpack_gen:`CPack Archive Generator` always used
the current user's UID/GID in archive entries.  CMake 4.3 added the
:variable:`CPACK_ARCHIVE_UID` and :variable:`CPACK_ARCHIVE_GID` variables
to control them.  If either is set, the default for the other is ``0``.
If neither is set, CMake 4.3 and above prefer to default both UID and GID
to ``0`` so that unpacking by ``root`` produces paths owned by ``root``.
This policy provides compatibility with projects that have not been updated
to expect the new behavior.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to produce archive entries with
the current user's UID/GID by default.
The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to produce archive entries with
the UID/GID set to 0/0 by default.
