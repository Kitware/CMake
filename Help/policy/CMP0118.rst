.. versionadded:: 3.20

The :prop_sf:`GENERATED` source file property is now visible in all directories.

Whether or not a source file is generated is an all-or-nothing global
property of the source.  Consequently, the associated ``GENERATED``
property is now visible from any directory scope, not only from the scope
for which it was set.

Additionally, the ``GENERATED`` property may now be set only to boolean
values, and may not be turned off once turned on.

The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is to only allow ``GENERATED`` to be
visible from the directory scope for which it was set.  The ``NEW``
behavior on the other hand allows it to be visible from any scope.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.20.  Use the
:command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
Unlike many policies, CMake version |release| does *not* warn
when this policy is not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior with regard
to visibility of the ``GENERATED`` property.  However, CMake does warn
about setting the ``GENERATED`` property to a non-boolean value.
