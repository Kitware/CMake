.. versionadded:: 3.27

:command:`find_package` uses upper-case ``<PACKAGENAME>_ROOT`` variables.

In CMake 3.27 and above the :command:`find_package(<PackageName>)` command now
searches prefixes specified by the upper-case :variable:`<PACKAGENAME>_ROOT`
CMake variable and the :envvar:`<PACKAGENAME>_ROOT` environment variable
in addition to the case-preserved :variable:`<PackageName>_ROOT` and
:envvar:`<PackageName>_ROOT` variables used since policy :policy:`CMP0074`.
This policy provides compatibility with projects that have not been
updated to avoid using ``<PACKAGENAME>_ROOT`` variables for other purposes.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore ``<PACKAGENAME>_ROOT``
variables if the original ``<PackageName>`` has lower-case characters.
The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to use ``<PACKAGENAME>_ROOT``
variables.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.27.  CMake version
|release| warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.
Use the :command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly.
