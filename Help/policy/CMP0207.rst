:command:`file(GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES)` normalizes paths before matching.

The :command:`file(GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES)` and
:command:`install(RUNTIME_DEPENDENCY_SET)` commands support filtering
resolved dependencies using regular expressions matching their paths.
In CMake 4.2 and below, callers were responsible for matching both forward
and backward slashes as path separators on Windows, e.g., via ``[\/]``.
CMake 4.3 and above prefer to normalize paths to use forward slashes before
matching.  This policy provides compaitiblity for projects that may have
been relying on matching backslashes only.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy matches filters against paths that
may contain any combination of forward and backward slashes on Windows.
The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy to convert all paths to forward
slashes before matching filters.
