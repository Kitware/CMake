CMP0066
-------

Deprecate the ``_LIB_DEPENDS`` variables.

Instead, the values are stored as global properties.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to set ``_LIB_DEPENDS`` variables. The
``NEW`` behavior is to only store them as properties.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.4.  CMake version
|release| warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use
the :command:`cmake_policy()` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly.
