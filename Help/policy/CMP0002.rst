Logical target names must be globally unique.

Targets names created with :command:`add_executable`, :command:`add_library`, or
:command:`add_custom_target` are logical build target names.  Logical target
names must be globally unique because:

::

  - Unique names may be referenced unambiguously both in CMake
    code and on make tool command lines.
  - Logical names are used by Xcode and VS IDE generators
    to produce meaningful project names for the targets.

The logical name of executable and library targets does not have to
correspond to the physical file names built.  Consider using the
:prop_tgt:`OUTPUT_NAME` target property to create two targets with the same
physical name while keeping logical names distinct.  Custom targets
must simply have globally unique names (unless one uses the global
property :prop_gbl:`ALLOW_DUPLICATE_CUSTOM_TARGETS` with a Makefiles generator).
