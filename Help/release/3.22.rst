Changes made since CMake 3.21 include the following.

New Features
============

Commands
--------

* The :command:`cmake_host_system_information` command can now query
  `OS identification variables`_ from the :file:`/etc/os-release` file.

* The :command:`string(TIMESTAMP)` command now supports the ``%V``
  specifier for ISO 8601 week numbers.

.. _`OS identification variables`: https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/os-release.html

Variables
---------

* The :envvar:`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` environment variable was added to
  provide a default value for the :variable:`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` variable.

* The :envvar:`CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES` environment variable was added to
  provide a default value for the :variable:`CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES`
  variable.

* The :envvar:`CMAKE_INSTALL_MODE` environment variable was added to
  tell :command:`install` rules (implemented by :command:`file(INSTALL)`)
  to install symbolic links instead of copying of files.

* The :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_LINK_WHAT_YOU_USE_FLAG` and
  :variable:`CMAKE_LINK_WHAT_YOU_USE_CHECK` variables were added to
  control the linker flag and check used by the
  :prop_tgt:`LINK_WHAT_YOU_USE` target property.

* The :variable:`CMAKE_REQUIRE_FIND_PACKAGE_<PackageName>` variable
  was added to turn a non-REQUIRED :command:`find_package` call into
  a REQUIRED one.

Properties
----------

* The :prop_tgt:`<LANG>_EXTENSIONS` target property is now initialized to
  :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_EXTENSIONS_DEFAULT`, detected from the compiler.
  See :policy:`CMP0128`.

* The :prop_sf:`VS_SETTINGS` source file property is now supported for
  all source file types.  Previously it worked only for non-built sources.

Modules
-------

* The :module:`CMakeDependentOption` module :command:`cmake_dependent_option`
  macro now supports full :ref:`Condition Syntax`.
  See policy :policy:`CMP0127`.

* The :module:`FetchContent` module now passes through the
  :variable:`CMAKE_TLS_VERIFY`, :variable:`CMAKE_TLS_CAINFO`,
  :variable:`CMAKE_NETRC` and :variable:`CMAKE_NETRC_FILE` variables (when
  defined) to the underlying :module:`ExternalProject` sub-build.
  Previously, those variables were silently ignored by :module:`FetchContent`.

* The :module:`FindBLAS` and :module:`FindLAPACK` modules gained
  a ``BLA_SIZEOF_INTEGER`` option to find a BLAS/LAPACK whose ABI
  uses a specific integer size.

* The :module:`FindJasper` module now provides an imported target.

* The :module:`FindMatlab` module now provides imported targets.

* The :module:`FindPkgConfig` module gained a :variable:`PKG_CONFIG_ARGN`
  variable to specify arguments to ``pkg-config`` calls.

* The :module:`GoogleTest` module :command:`gtest_discover_tests`
  function gained a ``TEST_FILTER`` option to filter tests using
  ``--gtest_filter`` during test discovery.

* The :module:`UseSWIG` module, for :ref:`Visual Studio Generators`,
  can now use the ``swig`` tool to generate implicit dependencies.

CTest
-----

* :manual:`ctest(1)` learned to recognize labels attached to a test at run time.
  Previously it was only possible to attach labels to tests at configure time
  by using the :prop_test:`LABELS` test property.
  See :ref:`Additional Test Measurements` for more information.

* :manual:`ctest(1)` learned to be able to modify the environment for a test
  through the :prop_test:`ENVIRONMENT_MODIFICATION` property. This is allows
  for updates to environment variables based on the environment present at
  test time.

* The :command:`ctest_memcheck` command now also generates a
  :file:`DynamicAnalysis-Test.xml` file which may be used to submit test
  results to CDash.

CPack
-----

* The :cpack_gen:`CPack DEB Generator` gained the
  option to set :variable:`CPACK_DEBIAN_COMPRESSION_TYPE` to ``zstd``,
  which enables Zstandard compression for deb packages.

* The :cpack_gen:`CPack NSIS Generator` gained a new
  :variable:`CPACK_NSIS_IGNORE_LICENSE_PAGE` variable to suppress
  the license page in the installer.

* The :cpack_gen:`CPack RPM Generator` gained the
  :variable:`CPACK_RPM_REQUIRES_EXCLUDE_FROM` option to avoid scanning
  specific paths for dependencies.

Deprecated and Removed Features
===============================

* The :generator:`Visual Studio 10 2010` generator is now deprecated
  and will be removed in a future version of CMake.

Other Changes
=============

* The :manual:`Compile Features <cmake-compile-features(7)>` functionality now
  correctly disables or enables compiler extensions when no standard level is
  specified and avoids unnecessarily adding language standard flags if the
  requested settings match the compiler's defaults. See :policy:`CMP0128`.

* The :manual:`Compile Features <cmake-compile-features(7)>` functionality
  now ignores features for languages that are not enabled.

* The :ref:`Ninja Generators` now implement the ``edit_cache`` target
  using :manual:`ccmake(1)` if available.

* The :generator:`Ninja` and :generator:`NMake Makefiles` generators
  now use the MSVC ``-external:I`` flag for system includes.
  This became available as of VS 16.10 (toolchain version 14.29.30037).

* The :cpack_gen:`CPack NSIS Generator` now requires NSIS 3.03 or later.

Updates
=======

Changes made since CMake 3.22.0 include the following.

3.22.1
------

* This version made no changes to documented features or interfaces.
  Some implementation updates were made to support ecosystem changes
  and/or fix regressions.

3.22.2
------

* The ``OLD`` behavior of :policy:`CMP0128` was fixed to add flags even when
  the specified standard matches the compiler default.

3.22.3
------

* The :command:`while` command again ignores errors in condition evaluation
  as CMake 3.21 and below did.  This bug was fixed in 3.22.0, but exposed
  errors in existing projects.  The fix has been reverted to restore
  compatibility.  The fix may be restored in a future version of CMake
  via a policy.

3.22.4, 3.22.5, 3.22.6
----------------------

* These versions made no changes to documented features or interfaces.
  Some implementation updates were made to support ecosystem changes
  and/or fix regressions.
