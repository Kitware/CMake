------------------------

* On Linux and FreeBSD platforms, when building CMake itself from source and
  not using a system-provided libcurl, OpenSSL is now used by default if it is
  found on the system.  This enables SSL/TLS support for commands supporting
  network communication via ``https``, such as :command:`file(DOWNLOAD)`,
  :command:`file(UPLOAD)`, and :command:`ctest_submit`.
