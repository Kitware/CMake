.. cmake-manual-description: CMake C++ Modules Support Reference

cmake-cxxmodules(7)
*******************

.. versionadded:: 3.28

C++ 20 introduced the concept of ":term:`modules <C++ module>`" to the
language.  The design requires :term:`build systems <build system>` to order
compilations to satisfy ``import`` statements reliably.  CMake's
implementation asks the compiler to scan source files for module dependencies
during the build, collates scanning results to infer ordering constraints, and
tells the :term:`build tool` how to dynamically update the
build graph.

Compilation Strategy
====================

With C++ modules, compiling a set of C++ sources is no longer
:term:`embarrassingly parallel`.  That is, any given source may require the
compilation of another source file first in order to provide a
":abbr:`BMI (built module interface)`" (or
":abbr:`CMI (compiled module interface)`") that C++ compilers use to satisfy
``import`` statements in other sources.  With included headers, sources could
share their declarations so that any consumers could compile independently.
With modules, the compiler now generates :term:`BMI` files during compilation
based on the contents of the source file and its ``export`` statements.  This
means that, to ensure a correct build without having to regenerate the build
graph (by running configure and generate steps) for every source change, the
correct ordering must be determined from the source files during the build
phase.

:term:`Build systems <build system>` must be able to order these compilations
within the build graph.  There are multiple strategies that are suitable for
this, but each has advantages and disadvantages.  CMake uses a "scanning" step
strategy, which is the most visible modules-related change for CMake users in
the context of the build.  CMake provides multiple ways to control the
scanning behavior of source files.

Scanning Control
================

Whether or not sources get scanned for C++ module usage is dependent on the
following queries.  The first query that provides a decision of whether to
scan or not is used.

- If the source file belongs to a file set of type ``CXX_MODULES``, it will
  be scanned.
- If the target does not use at least C++ 20, it will not be scanned.
- If the source file is not the language ``CXX``, it will not be scanned.
- If the :prop_sf:`CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES` source file property is set, its
  value will be used.
- If the :prop_tgt:`CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES` target property is set, its value
  will be used.  Set the :variable:`CMAKE_CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES` variable
  to initialize this property on all targets as they are created.
- Otherwise, the source file will be scanned if the compiler and generator
  support scanning.  See policy :policy:`CMP0155`.

Note that any scanned source will be excluded from any unity build (see
:prop_tgt:`UNITY_BUILD`) because module-related statements can only happen at
one place within a C++ translation unit.

Compiler Support
================

The list of compilers for which CMake supports scanning sources for C++
modules includes:

* MSVC toolset 14.34 and newer (provided with Visual Studio 17.4 and newer)
* LLVM/Clang 16.0 and newer
* GCC 14 and newer

``import std`` Support
======================

Support for ``import std`` is limited to the following toolchain and standard
library combinations:

* Clang 18.1.2 and newer with ``-stdlib=libc++`` or ``-stdlib=libstdc++``
* MSVC toolset 14.36 and newer (provided with Visual Studio 17.6 Preview 2 and
  newer)
* GCC 15 and newer

The :variable:`CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_IMPORT_STD` variable lists standard levels
which have support for ``import std`` in the active C++ toolchain.

.. note::

   This support is provided only when experimental support for
   ``import std`` has been enabled by the
   ``CMAKE_EXPERIMENTAL_CXX_IMPORT_STD`` gate.

Generator Support
=================

The list of generators which support scanning sources for C++ modules
includes:

- :generator:`Ninja`
- :generator:`Ninja Multi-Config`
- :generator:`Visual Studio 17 2022`
- :generator:`Visual Studio 18 2026`

Note that the :ref:`Ninja Generators` require ``ninja`` 1.11 or newer.

Limitations
-----------

There are a number of known limitations of the current C++ module support in
CMake.  Known limitations or bugs in compilers are not listed here, as these
can change over time.

For all generators:

- :term:`Header units <header unit>` are not supported.
- There is no builtin support for ``import std`` or other compiler-provided
  modules.

For the :ref:`Visual Studio Generators`:

- Only Visual Studio 2022 and MSVC toolsets 14.34 (Visual Studio
  17.4) and newer are supported.
- Exporting or installing :term:`BMI` or module information is not supported.
- Compiling :term:`BMIs <BMI>` from ``IMPORTED`` targets with C++ modules
  (including ``import std``) is not supported.
- Use of modules provided by ``PRIVATE`` sources from ``PUBLIC`` module
  sources is not diagnosed.

Usage
=====

Troubleshooting CMake
---------------------

This section aims to answer common questions about CMake's implementation and
to help diagnose or explain errors in CMake's C++ modules support.

File Extension Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CMake imposes no requirements upon file extensions for modules of any unit
type.  While there are preferences that differ between toolchains (e.g.,
``.ixx`` on MSVC and ``.cppm`` on Clang), there is no universally agreed-upon
extension.  As such, CMake only requires that the file be recognized as a
``CXX``-language source file.  By default, any recognized extension will
suffice, but the :prop_sf:`LANGUAGE` property may be used with any other
extension as well.

File Name Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The name of a module has no relation to the name or path of the file in which
its declaration resides.  The C++ standard has no requirements here and
neither does CMake.  However, it may be useful to have some pattern in use
within a project for easier navigation within environments that lack IDE-like
"find symbol" functionality (e.g., on code review platforms).

Scanning Without Modules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A common problem for projects that have not yet adopted modules is unnecessary
scanning of sources.  This typically happens when a C++20 project becomes
aware of CMake 3.28, or a 3.28-aware project starts using C++20.  Either case
ends up setting :policy:`CMP0155` to ``NEW``, which enables scanning of C++
sources with C++20 or newer by default.  The easiest way for projects to turn
this off is to add:

.. code-block:: cmake

   set(CMAKE_CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES 0)

near the top of their top-level ``CMakeLists.txt`` file.  Note that it should
**not** be in the cache, as it may otherwise affect projects using it via
``FetchContent``.  Attention should also be paid to vendored projects which
may want to enable scanning for their own sources, as this would change the
default for them as well.

Debugging Module Builds
-----------------------

This section aims to help diagnose or explain common errors that may arise on
the build side of CMake's C++ modules support.

Import Cycles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The C++ standard does not allow for cycles in the ``import`` graph of a
:term:`translation unit`; therefore, CMake does not either.  Currently, CMake
will leave it to the :term:`build tool` to detect this based on the
:term:`dynamic dependencies` used to order module compilations.
`CMake Issue 26119`_ tracks the desire to improve the user experience in this
case.

.. _`CMake Issue 26119`: https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/26119

Internal Module Partition Extension
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the implementation of building C++ modules was first investigated, it
appeared as though there existed a type of :term:`translation unit` that
represented the intersection of a :term:`partition unit` and an
:term:`implementation unit`.  Initial CMake designs included specific support
for these translation units; however, after a closer reading of the standard,
these did not actually exist.  These units would have had ``module M:part;``
as their module declaration statement.  The problem is that this is also the
exact syntax also used for declaring module partitions that do not contribute
to the external interface of the primary module.  Only MSVC supports this
distinction.  Other compilers do not and will treat such files as an
:term:`internal partition unit` and CMake will raise an error that a
module-providing C++ source must be in a ``FILE_SET`` of type ``CXX_MODULES``.

The fix is to not use the extension, as it provides no further expressivity
over not using the extension.  All :term:`implementation unit` source files
should instead only use ``module M;`` as their module declaration statement
regardless of what partition the defined entities are declared within.  As an
example:

.. code-block:: cpp

   // module-interface.cpp
   export module M;
   export int foo();

   // module-impl.cpp
   module M:part; // module M:part; looks like an internal partition
   int foo() { return 42; }

Instead use explicit interface/implementation separation:

.. code-block:: cpp

   // module-interface.cpp
   export module M;
   export int foo();

   // module-impl.cpp
   module M;
   int foo() { return 42; }

Module Visibility
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CMake enforces :term:`module visibility` between and within targets.  This
essentially means that a module (say, ``I``) provided from a ``PRIVATE``
``FILE_SET`` on a target ``T`` may not be imported by:

- other targets depending on ``T``; or
- modules provided from a ``PUBLIC`` ``FILE_SET`` on target ``T`` itself.

This is because, in general, all imported entities from a module must also be
importable by all potential importers of that module.  Even if module ``I`` is
only used within parts of a module without the ``export`` keyword, it may
affect things within it in such a way that consumers of the module need to be
able to transitively ``import`` it to work correctly.  As CMake uses the
module visibility to determine whether to install :term:`module interface
units <module interface unit>`, a ``PRIVATE`` module interface unit will not
be installed, meaning that usage of any installed module which imports ``I``
would not work.

Instead, import ``PRIVATE`` C++ modules only from within an
:term:`implementation unit`, as these are not exposed to consumers of any
module.

Design
======

The design of CMake's C++ module support makes a number of trade-offs compared
to other designs.  First, CMake's chosen design will be covered.  Later
sections cover alternative designs that were not chosen for CMake's
implementation.

Overall, the designs fall somewhere along two axes:

.. list-table::

   * - Explicit Dynamic
     - Explicit Static
     - Explicit Fixed
   * - Implicit Dynamic
     - Implicit Static
     - Implicit Fixed

* **Explicit** builds control which modules are visible to each translation
  unit directly.  For example, when compiling a source requiring a module
  ``M``, the compiler will be given information which states the exact BMI
  file to use when importing the ``M`` module.
* **Implicit** builds can control module visibility as well, but do so by
  instead grouping :term:`BMIs <BMI>` into directories which are then searched
  for files to satisfy ``import`` statements in the source file.
* **Static** builds use a static set of build commands in order to complete
  the build.  There must be support to add edges between nodes at build time.
* **Dynamic** builds may create new build commands during the build and
  schedule any discovered work during the build.
* **Fixed** builds are generated with all module dependencies already known.

Design Goals
------------

CMake's implementation of building C++ modules focuses on the following design
goals:

1. `Correct Builds <design-goal-correct-builds_>`__
2. `Deterministic Builds <design-goal-deterministic-builds_>`__
3. `Support Generated Sources <design-goal-generated-sources_>`__
4. `Static Communication <design-goal-static-communication_>`__
5. `Minimize Regeneration <design-goal-minimize-regeneration_>`__

.. _design-goal-correct-builds:

Correct Builds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Above all else, an incorrect build is a frustrating experience for all
involved.  A build which does not detect errors and instead lets a build with
detectable problems run to completion is a good way to start wild goose chase
debugging sessions.  CMake errs on the side of avoiding such situations.

.. _design-goal-deterministic-builds:

Deterministic Builds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Given an on-disk state of a build, it should be possible to determine what
steps will happen next.  This does not mean that the exact order of rules
within the build that can be run concurrently is deterministic, but instead
that the set of work to be done and its results are deterministic.  For
example, if there is no dependency between tasks ``A`` and ``B``, ``A`` should
have no effects on the execution of ``B`` and vice versa.

.. _design-goal-generated-sources:

Support Generated Sources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Code generation is prevalent in the C++ ecosystem, so only supporting modules
in files whose content is known at configure time is not suitable.  Without
supporting generated sources which use or provide modules, code generation
tools are effectively cut off from the use of modules, and any dependencies of
generated sources must also provide non-modular ways of using their interfaces
(i.e., provide headers).  Given that all C++ implementations use :term:`strong
module ownership` for symbol mangling, this is problematic when such
interfaces end up referring to compiled symbols in other libraries.

.. _design-goal-static-communication:

Static Communication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All communication between different steps of the build should be handled
statically.  Given the :term:`build tools <build tool>` that CMake supports,
it is challenging to establish a controlled lifetime for a companion tool that
needs to interact during compilation.  Neither ``make`` nor ``ninja`` offer a
way to start a tool at the beginning of a build and ensure it is stopped at
the end.  Instead, communication with compilers is managed through input and
output files, using dependencies in the :term:`build tool` to keep everything
up-to-date.  This approach enables standard debugging strategies for builds
and allows developers to run build commands directly when investigating
issues, without needing to account for other tools running in the background.

.. _design-goal-minimize-regeneration:

Minimize Regeneration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Active development of a build with modules should not require the build graph
to be regenerated on every change.  This means that the module dependencies
must be constructed after the build graph is available.  Without this, a
`correct build <design-goal-correct-builds_>`__ would need to regenerate the
build graph any time a module-aware source file is edited, as any changes may
alter module dependencies.

It also means that all module-aware sources must be known at configure time
(even if they do not yet exist) so that the build graph can include the
commands to :term:`scan` for their dependencies.

.. note::

  There is a known issue with ``ninja`` which can result in an erroneous
  detection of a dependency cycle when the dependency order between two
  sources reverses (i.e., `a` importing `b` becomes `b` importing `a`) between
  two builds.  See `ninja issue 2666`_ for details.

.. _`ninja issue 2666`: https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/issues/2666

Use Case Considerations
-----------------------

The design goals described above constrain the implementation.  Additionally,
mixed configurations are supported by CMake via multi-config generators such
as :generator:`Ninja Multi-Config` and :ref:`Visual Studio Generators`.  This
section describes how CMake addresses these constraints.

Selected Design
---------------

The general strategy CMake uses is to ":term:`scan`" sources to extract the
ordering dependency information and update the build graph with new edges
between existing edges.  This is done by taking the per-source scan results
(represented by `P1689R5`_ files) and then ":term:`collating <collate>`" them
for each target with information from its dependencies.  The primary task of
the collator is to generate ":term:`module map`" files to pass to each compile
rule with the paths to the :term:`BMIs <BMI>` needed to satisfy ``import``
statements, and to inform the :term:`build tool` of dependencies needed to
satisfy those ``import`` statements during the compilation.  The collator also
uses the build-time information to generate ``install`` rules for the module
interface units, their :term:`BMIs <BMI>`, and properties for any exported
targets with C++ modules.  It also enforces that ``PRIVATE`` modules may not
be used by other targets or by any ``PUBLIC`` :term:`module interface unit`
within the target.

.. _`P1689R5`: https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/p1689r5.html

Alternative Designs
-------------------

There are alternative designs that CMake does not implement.  This section
aims to give a brief overview and to explain why they were not chosen for
CMake's implementation.

Implicit Builds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An implicit build performs module builds using compile-time search paths to
make the implementation of the build simpler.  This is certainly something
that can be made to work.  However, CMake's goals exclude it as a solution.

When a build uses search directory management, the compiler is directed to
place module output files into a specified directory.  These directories are
then provided as search paths to any compilation allowed to use the modules
within them.

This strategy risks running into problems with the
`Correct Builds <design-goal-correct-builds_>`__ goal.  This stems from the
hazard of stale files being present in the search directories.  Since the
build system is unaware of the actual files being written, it is difficult to
know which files are allowed to be deleted (e.g., using ``ninja -t cleandead``
to remove outputs ``ninja`` has encountered but are no longer generated).
Removal of intermediate files may also cause the build to become stuck if the
outputs are not known to the build system beyond consumers reporting "usage of
file X".

There is also a need to at least do some level of ordering of :term:`BMI`
generation commands which share an output directory.  Separate directories may
be used to order groups of modules (e.g., one directory per target);
otherwise, modules within the same directory may not assume that other modules
writing to the shared directory will complete first.  If module paths are
grouped accurately according to the module dependency graph, it is a small
step to being an explicit build where the files are directly specified.

Static Scanning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A :term:`fixed build` performs a scan while generating the build graph and
includes the necessary dependencies up-front.  In CMake's case, it would look
at the source files during the generate phase and add the dependencies
directly to the build graph.  This is more likely to be suitable for a
:term:`build system` that is also its own :term:`build tool` where build graph
manipulation can be done cooperatively.

No matter whether it is integrated or not, this strategy necessitates either a
suitable C++ parser to extract the information in the first place, or toolchain
cooperation to obtain it.  While module dependency information is available to
a simpler C++ parser, dependencies may be hidden behind preprocessor
conditionals that need to be understood in order to be accurate.  Of course,
choosing to not support preprocessor conditionals around ``import`` statements
is also an option, but this may severely limit external library support.

For CMake, this strategy would mean that any change to a module-aware source
file may need to trigger regeneration of the build graph.  A benign edit would
at least need to trigger the *check* for changed imports, but may skip
actually regenerating if it is unchanged.  This may be less critical for a
:term:`build system` which is also its own :term:`build tool`, but it is a
direct violation of the
`Minimize Regeneration <design-goal-minimize-regeneration_>`__ goal.

Additionally, CMake's
`Support Generated Sources <design-goal-generated-sources_>`__ goal would be
unsupportable with this strategy.  CMake could defer scanning until the
generated files are available, but those sources cannot be compiled until such
a scan has been performed.  This would mean that there would be some unbounded
(but finite) number of regenerations of the build graph as sources become
available.

Module Mapping Service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Another strategy is to run a service alongside the build that can act as an
oracle for where to place and discover modules.  The compiler is instructed to
query the service with questions such as "this source is exporting module X"
and "this source is importing module Y" and receive the path to either create
or find the :term:`BMI`, respectively.  In this case, the service dynamically
implements the collation logic.

Of particular note, this conflicts with the
`Deterministic Builds <design-goal-deterministic-builds_>`__ and
`Static Communication <design-goal-static-communication_>`__ goals because the
on-disk state may not match the actual state, and coordinating the lifetime of
the :term:`build tool` itself with the service is difficult.  The primary
missing feature is some signal when a build session starts and ends so that
such a service can know in what context it is answering requests.  There also
needs to be a way to resume a session and detect when a session is
invalidated.  No :term:`build tool` that CMake supports today has such
features.

There are also hazards which conflict with the
`Correct Builds <design-goal-correct-builds_>`__ goal.  When a module is
imported, the compiler waits for a response before continuing.  However, there
is no guarantee that a (visible) module of that name even exists, so it may
wait indefinitely.  While waiting for a compilation to report that it creates
that module, it may run into a dependency cycle which leaves the compilations
hanging until some resource limit is reached (probably time, or that all
possible providers of the module have not reported a module of that name).
While these compilations are waiting on answers, there is the question of how
they affect the parallelism limits of the :term:`build tool` in use.  Do
compilations waiting on an answer count towards the limit and block other
compilations from launching to potentially discover the module?  If they do
not, what about other resources that may be held in use by those compilations
(e.g., memory or available file descriptors)?

Possible Future Enhancements
============================

This section documents possible future enhancements to CMake's support of C++
modules.  Nothing here is a guarantee of future implementation, and the
ordering is arbitrary.

Batch Scanning
--------------

It is possible to scan all sources within a target at once, which should be
faster when sources share transitive includes.  This does have side effects
for incremental builds, as the update of any source in the target means that
all sources in the target are scanned again.  Given how much faster scanning
can be, it should be negligible to do such "extra" scanning assuming that
unchanged results do not trigger recompilations.

BMI Modification Optimization
-----------------------------

Currently, as with object files, compilers always update a :term:`BMI` file
even if the contents have not changed.  Because modules increase the potential
scope of "non-changes" to cause (conceptually) unnecessary recompilation, it
might be useful to avoid recompilation of module consumers if the :term:`BMI`
file has not changed.  This might be achieved by wrapping the compilation to
juggle the :term:`BMI` through a ``cmake -E copy_if_different`` pass with
``ninja``'s ``restat = 1`` feature to avoid recompiling importers if the
:term:`BMI` file doesn't actually change.

.. _`easier-source-specification`:

Easier Source Specification
---------------------------

The initial implementation of CMake's module support had used the "just list
sources; CMake will figure it out" pattern.  However, this ran into issues
related to other metadata requirements.  These were discovered while
implementing CMake support beyond just building the modules-using code.

Conflicts with `Separate BMI Generation <separate-bmi-generation_>`__ on a
single target, as that requires knowledge of all :term:`BMI`-generating rules
at generate time.

.. _`separate-bmi-generation`:

Separate BMI Generation
-----------------------

CMake currently uses a single rule to generate both the :term:`BMI` and the
object file for a compilation.  At least Clang supports compiling an object
directly from the :term:`BMI`.  This would be beneficial because :term:`BMI`
generation is typically faster than compilation and generating the :term:`BMI`
as a separate step allows importers to start compiling without waiting for the
object to also be generated.

This is not supported in the current implementation as only Clang supports
generating an object directly from the :term:`BMI`.  Other compilers either do
not support such a two-phase generation (GCC) or need to start object
compilation from the source again.

Conflicts with `Easier Source Specification <easier-source-specification_>`__
on a single target because CMake must know all :term:`BMI`-generating sources
at generate time rather than build time to create the two-phase rules.

Module Compilation Glossary
===========================

.. glossary::

   BMI
     Built Module Interface.  A compiler-generated binary representation of a
     C++ module's interface that is required by consumers of the module.  File
     extensions vary by compiler.

   CMI
     Compiled Module Interface.  Alternative name for :term:`BMI` used by some
     compilers.

   build system
     A tool that facilitates the building of software which includes a model
     of how components of the build relate to each other.  For example, CMake,
     Meson, build2, and more.

   build tool
     A build graph execution tool.  For example, `ninja` and `make`.  Some
     build tools are also their own :term:`build system`.

   C++ module
     A C++20 language feature for describing the API of a piece of software.
     Intended as a replacement for headers for this purpose.

   collate
     The process of aggregating module information from scanned sources to
     ensure correct compilation order and to provide metadata for other parts
     of the build (e.g., installation or a :term:`build database`).

   dynamic dependencies
     Dependencies which require a separate command to detect so that a further
     command may have its dependencies satisfied.

   embarrassingly parallel
     A set of tasks which, due to having minimal dependencies between them,
     can be easily divided into many independent tasks that can be executed
     concurrently.

   explicit build
     A build strategy where module dependencies are explicitly specified
     rather than discovered.

   fixed build
     A build strategy where all module dependencies are computed and inserted
     directly into the build graph.

   header unit
     A header file which is used via an ``import`` statement rather than an
     ``#include`` preprocessor directive.  Implementations may provide support
     for treating ``#include`` as ``import`` as well.

   implementation unit
     A C++ :term:`translation unit` that implements module entities declared
     in a module interface unit.

   implicit build
     A build strategy where module dependencies are discovered by searching
     for :term:`BMI` files during compilation.

   internal partition unit
     A :term:`translation unit` which contains a partition name and is not
     exported from the :term:`primary module interface unit`.

   module interface unit
     A :term:`translation unit` that declares a module's public interface
     using ``export module``.  Such a unit may or may not be also be a
     :term:`partition unit`.

   module visibility
     CMake's enforcement of access rules for modules based on their
     declaration scope (PUBLIC/PRIVATE).

   partition unit
     A :term:`translation unit` which describes a module with a partition name
     (i.e., `module MODNAME:PARTITION;`).  The partition may or may not use
     the ``export`` keyword.  If it does, it is also a
     :term:`module interface unit`; otherwise, it is a
     :term:`internal partition unit`.

   primary module interface unit
     A :term:`module interface unit` which exports a named module that is not
     a :term:`partition unit`.

   scan
     The process of analyzing a :term:`translation unit` to discover module
     imports and exports.

   strong module ownership
     C++ implementations have settled on a model where the module "owns" the
     symbols declared within it.  In practice, this means that the module name
     is included into the symbol mangling of entities declared within it.

   translation unit
     The smallest component of a compilation for a C++ program.  Generally,
     there is one translation unit per source file.  C++ source files which do
     not use C++ modules may be combined into a single translation unit.
