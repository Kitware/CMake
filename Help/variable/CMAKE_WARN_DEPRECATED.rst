CMAKE_WARN_DEPRECATED
---------------------

Whether to issue deprecation warnings for macros and functions.

If ``TRUE``, this can be used by macros and functions to issue deprecation
warnings.  This variable is ``FALSE`` by default.

These warnings can be enabled with the ``-Wdeprecated`` option, or
disabled with the ``-Wno-deprecated`` option, when running
:manual:`cmake(1)`.
