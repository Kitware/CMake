CMAKE_DEPENDS_USE_COMPILER
--------------------------

.. versionadded:: 3.20

For the :ref:`Makefile Generators`, source dependencies are now, for a
selection of compilers, generated by the compiler itself. By defining this
variable with value ``FALSE``, you can restore the legacy behavior (i.e. using
CMake for dependencies discovery).
