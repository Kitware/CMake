CMAKE_<LANG>_IMPLICIT_LINK_LIBRARIES
------------------------------------

Implicit link libraries and flags detected for language ``<LANG>``.

Compilers typically pass language runtime library names and other
flags when they invoke a linker.  These flags are implicit link
options for the compiler's language.  For each language enabled
by the :command:`project` or :command:`enable_language` command,
CMake automatically detects these libraries and flags and reports
the results in this variable.

When linking to a static library, CMake adds the implicit link libraries and
flags from this variable for each language used in the static library (except
the language whose compiler is used to drive linking).  In the case of an
imported static library, the :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES`
target property lists the languages whose implicit link information is
needed.  If any of the languages is not enabled, its value for the
``CMAKE_<LANG>_IMPLICIT_LINK_LIBRARIES`` variable may instead be provided
by the project.  Or, a :variable:`toolchain file <CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE>`
may set the variable to a value known for the specified toolchain.  It will
either be overridden when the language is enabled, or used as a fallback.

See also the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_IMPLICIT_LINK_DIRECTORIES` variable.
