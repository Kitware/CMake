CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME
-----------------

The name of the operating system for which CMake is to build.
See the :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION` variable for the OS version.

Note that ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME`` is not set to anything by default when running
in script mode, since it's not building anything.

System Name for Host Builds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME`` is by default set to the same value as the
:variable:`CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME` variable so that the build
targets the host system.

System Name for Cross Compiling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME`` may be set explicitly when first configuring a new build
tree in order to enable :ref:`cross compiling <Cross Compiling Toolchain>`.
In this case the :variable:`CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION` variable must also be
set explicitly.

========================= ======================================================

Platform-specific notes:

* MSYS2's ``msys/cmake`` package (``/usr/bin/cmake``) works only under
  ``MSYSTEM=MSYS`` environments, with system name ``MSYS``.  Under other
  environments like ``MSYSTEM=MINGW64``, use another package such
  as ``mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake`` (``/mingw64/bin/cmake``),
  which targets ``MSYSTEM=MINGW64`` with system name ``Windows``.

* Cygwin's ``cmake`` package (``/usr/bin/cmake``) uses system name ``CYGWIN``.
  A non-cygwin CMake on Windows (e.g. ``$PROGRAMFILES/CMake/bin/cmake``)
  uses system name ``Windows`` even when it runs under a Cygwin environment.
