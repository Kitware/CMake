LABELS
------

Specify a list of text labels associated with a test.  The labels are
reported in both the ``ctest`` output summary and in dashboard submissions.
They can also be used to filter the set of tests to be executed (see the
:option:`ctest -L` and :option:`ctest -LE` options).

See :ref:`Additional Labels` for adding labels to a test dynamically during
test execution.
