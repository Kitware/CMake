ctest_upload
------------

Upload files to a dashboard server.

::

  ctest_upload(FILES ... [QUIET])

Pass a list of files to be sent along with the build results to the
dashboard server.

The QUIET option suppresses any CTest-specific non-error output
that would have been printed to the console otherwise.
