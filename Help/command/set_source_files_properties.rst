set_source_files_properties
---------------------------

Source files can have properties that affect how they are built.

.. code-block:: cmake

  set_source_files_properties([file1 [file2 [...]]]
                              PROPERTIES prop1 value1
                              [prop2 value2 [...]])

Sets properties associated with source files using a key/value paired
list.

See also the :command:`set_property(SOURCE)` command.

See :ref:`Source File Properties` for the list of properties known
to CMake.  Source file properties are visible only to targets added
in the same directory (CMakeLists.txt).
