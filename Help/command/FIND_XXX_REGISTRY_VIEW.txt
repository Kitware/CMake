Specify which registry views must be queried. This option is only meaningful
on ``Windows`` platform and will be ignored on other ones. When not
specified, |FIND_XXX_REGISTRY_VIEW_DEFAULT| view is used when :policy:`CMP0134`
policy is ``NEW``. Refer to :policy:`CMP0134` policy for default view when
policy is ``OLD`` or undefined.

``64``
  Query the 64bit registry. On ``32bit Windows``, returns always the string
  ``/REGISTRY-NOTFOUND``.

``32``
  Query the 32bit registry.

``64_32``
  Query both views (``64`` and ``32``) and generate a path for each.

``32_64``
  Query both views (``32`` and ``64``) and generate a path for each.

``HOST``
  Query the registry matching the architecture of the host: ``64`` on ``64bit
  Windows`` and ``32`` on ``32bit Windows``.

``TARGET``
  Query the registry matching the architecture specified by
  :variable:`CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P` variable. If not defined, fallback to
  ``HOST`` view.

``BOTH``
  Query both views (``32`` and ``64``). The order depends of the following
  rules: If :variable:`CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P` variable is defined. Use the
  following view depending of the content of this variable:

  * ``8``: ``64_32``
  * ``4``: ``32_64``

  If :variable:`CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P` variable is not defined, rely on
  architecture of the host:

  * ``64bit``: ``64_32``
  * ``32bit``: ``32``
