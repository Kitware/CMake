ctest_test
----------

Run tests in the project build tree.

::

  ctest_test([BUILD build_dir] [APPEND]
             [START start number] [END end number]
             [STRIDE stride number] [EXCLUDE exclude regex ]
             [INCLUDE include regex] [RETURN_VALUE res]
             [EXCLUDE_LABEL exclude regex]
             [INCLUDE_LABEL label regex]
             [PARALLEL_LEVEL level]
             [SCHEDULE_RANDOM on]
             [STOP_TIME time of day])

Tests the given build directory and stores results in Test.xml.  The
second argument is a variable that will hold value.  Optionally, you
can specify the starting test number START, the ending test number
END, the number of tests to skip between each test STRIDE, a regular
expression for tests to run INCLUDE, or a regular expression for tests
to not run EXCLUDE.  EXCLUDE_LABEL and INCLUDE_LABEL are regular
expression for test to be included or excluded by the test property
LABEL.  PARALLEL_LEVEL should be set to a positive number representing
the number of tests to be run in parallel.  SCHEDULE_RANDOM will
launch tests in a random order, and is typically used to detect
implicit test dependencies.  STOP_TIME is the time of day at which the
tests should all stop running.

The APPEND option marks results for append to those previously
submitted to a dashboard server since the last ctest_start.  Append
semantics are defined by the dashboard server in use.

The QUIET option suppresses any CTest-specific non-error messages
that would have otherwise been printed to the console.  Output from
the underlying test command is not affected.  Summary info detailing
the percentage of passing tests is also unaffected by the QUIET
option.
