IMPORTED_OBJECTS_<CONFIG>
-------------------------

.. versionadded:: 3.9

``<CONFIG>``-specific version of :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_OBJECTS` property.

Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.


Xcode Generator Considerations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Do not use this ``<CONFIG>``-specific property if you need to use Xcode
variables like ``$(CURRENT_ARCH)`` or ``$(EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME)`` in
the value.  The ``<CONFIG>``-specific properties will be ignored in such
cases because CMake cannot determine whether a file exists at the
configuration-specific path at configuration time.  For such cases, use
:prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_OBJECTS` instead.
