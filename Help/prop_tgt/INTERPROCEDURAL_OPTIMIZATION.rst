INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION
----------------------------

Enable interprocedural optimization for a target.

If set to true, enables interprocedural optimizations if they are
known to be supported by the compiler.

This property is initialized by the
:variable:`CMAKE_INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION` variable if it is set when a
target is created.
