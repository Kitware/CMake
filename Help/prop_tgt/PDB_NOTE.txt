.. note::
 This property does not apply to STATIC library targets because no linker
 is invoked to produce them so they have no linker-generated ``.pdb`` file
 containing debug symbols.

 The compiler-generated program database files specified by the MSVC
 ``/Fd`` flag are not the same as linker-generated program database
 files and so are not influenced by this property.
