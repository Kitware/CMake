IMPORTED_IMPLIB
---------------

Full path to the import library for an ``IMPORTED`` target.

This property may be set:

* On DLL platforms, to the location of the ``.lib`` part of the DLL.
* On AIX, to an import file (e.g. ``.imp``) created for executables that export
  symbols (see the :prop_tgt:`ENABLE_EXPORTS` target property).
* On macOS, to an import file (e.g. ``.tbd``) created for shared libraries (see
  the :prop_tgt:`ENABLE_EXPORTS` target property). For frameworks this is the
  location of the ``.tbd`` file symlink just inside the framework folder.
* .. versionadded:: 3.28
    On non-DLL platforms, to the location of a shared library.
    When set without also specifying an :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_LOCATION`,
    the library is considered to be a stub, and its location will not
    be added as a runtime search path to dependents that link it.


The ``IMPORTED_IMPLIB`` target property may be overridden for a
given configuration ``<CONFIG>`` by the configuration-specific
:prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_IMPLIB_<CONFIG>` target property.  Furthermore,
the :prop_tgt:`MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>` target property may be
used to map between a project's configurations and those of an imported
target.  If none of these is set then the name of any other configuration
listed in the :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS` target property may be
selected and its :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_IMPLIB_<CONFIG>` value used.

This property is ignored for non-imported targets.
