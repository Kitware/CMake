CPack IFW Generator
-------------------

See :module:`CPackIFW` for details on the CPackIFW module.

.. _QtIFW: http://doc.qt.io/qtinstallerframework/index.html


Overview
^^^^^^^^

CPack ``IFW`` generator helps you to create online and offline
binary cross-platform installers with a graphical user interface.

CPack IFW generator prepares project installation and generates configuration
and meta information for QtIFW_ tools.

The QtIFW_ provides a set of tools and utilities to create
installers for the supported desktop Qt platforms: Linux, Microsoft Windows,
and macOS.

You should also install QtIFW_ to use CPack ``IFW`` generator.

Hints
^^^^^

Generally, the CPack ``IFW`` generator automatically finds QtIFW_ tools,
but if you don't use a default path for installation of the QtIFW_ tools,
the path may be specified in either a CMake or an environment variable:

.. variable:: CPACK_IFW_ROOT

 An CMake variable which specifies the location of the QtIFW_ tool suite.

 The variable will be cached in the ``CPackConfig.cmake`` file and used at
 CPack runtime.

.. variable:: QTIFWDIR

 An environment variable which specifies the location of the QtIFW_ tool
 suite.

.. note::
  The specified path should not contain "bin" at the end
  (for example: "D:\\DevTools\\QtIFW2.0.5").

The :variable:`CPACK_IFW_ROOT` variable has a higher priority and overrides
the value of the :variable:`QTIFWDIR` variable.

Internationalization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some variables and command arguments support internationalization via
CMake script. This is an optional feature.

Installers created by QtIFW_ tools have built-in support for
internationalization and many phrases are localized to many languages,
but this does not apply to the description of the your components and groups
that will be distributed.

Localization of the description of your components and groups is useful for
users of your installers.

A localized variable or argument can contain a single default value, and a
set of pairs the name of the locale and the localized value.

For example:

.. code-block:: cmake

   set(LOCALIZABLE_VARIABLE "Default value"
     en "English value"
     en_US "American value"
     en_GB "Great Britain value"
     )

Online installer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default CPack IFW generator makes offline installer. This means that all
components will be packaged into a binary file.

To make a component downloaded, you must set the ``DOWNLOADED`` option in
:command:`cpack_add_component`.

Then you would use the command :command:`cpack_configure_downloads`.
If you set ``ALL`` option all components will be downloaded.

You also can use command :command:`cpack_ifw_add_repository` and
variable :variable:`CPACK_IFW_DOWNLOAD_ALL` for more specific configuration.

CPack IFW generator creates "repository" dir in current binary dir. You
would copy content of this dir to specified ``site`` (``url``).
