AUTOMOC_TARGETS_FOLDER
----------------------

Name of FOLDER for *_automoc targets that are added automatically by CMake for targets for which AUTOMOC is enabled.

If not set, CMake uses the FOLDER property of the parent target as a
default value for this property.  See also the documentation for the
FOLDER target property and the AUTOMOC target property.
