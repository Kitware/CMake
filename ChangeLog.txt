	* Source/cmGlobalXCodeGenerator.cxx: Add Xcode SYMROOT setting for
	  custom targets

	  Xcode 1.5 writes helper scripts at the projectDirPath location
	  for targets that do not set SYMROOT.	We now add SYMROOT to
	  custom targets so that all targets set it.  This prevents Xcode
	  1.5 from touching the source directory now that we always set
	  projectDirPath.

	  See issue #8481.

	  dependency scanning.

	  Now only the dependencies for the file where the dependencies
	  actually may have changed are rescanned, before that this was
	  done for all source files even if only one source file had
	  changed.  This reduces e.g. on my machine the time for scanning
	  the dependencies of kdelibs/khtml/ when only one file
	  (khtml_global.cpp) has changed from around 7.5 seconds to 1.2
	  seconds.

	  The tests succeed, it does what I expected it to do on kdelibs,
	  and Brad also reviewed the patch, so I think it should be ok.

	* Source/: cmMakefileExecutableTargetGenerator.cxx,

	  PDB file names

	  Some vendor tools convert PDB file names given on the command
	  line to lower-case before creating the file.	When CMake places a
	  mixed-case PDB file name into the build system, the file does not
	  exist the first time and it is written with mixed case.  After
	  the first build though the native tool has created a lower-case
	  version of the file.	If CMake does CollapseFullPath again, the
	  file exists so the actual-case lookup gets the lower-case name.
	  This causes the build files to change so the project rebuilds.

	  The solution is to avoid calling CollapseFullPath for files
	  generated by the build.  In the case of PDB files we already
	  construct them from paths that have been collapsed, so we can
	  just skip the call altogether.  See issue #9350.

	  which case duplicate sources are fine).  This commit simply
	  removes the old-style check code.

	  directory might not exist later (like add_subdirectory called
	  inside a function of the parent scope).  This caused CMake to
	  crash when following the dangling pointer to the original parent
	  scope.

	  We fix the problem in this commit by always computing the closure
	  of the parent scope at directory initialization time so that no
	  parent scope pointer is needed.  See issue #9538.

	  We also simplify the cmProcess interface by making

	  When CMake is invoked by the VS IDE re-run rule we compute
	  whether or not CMake really needs to re-run based on some
	  timestamp helper files.  Previously we assumed that if the main
	  generate.stamp file exists then VS has correctly detected that
	  the file is out of date.  However, this assumption is too
	  aggressive and re-runs CMake unnecessarily sometimes.

	  This commit removes the assumption and always checks timestamps
	  itself.  The change breaks the explicit user re-run request
	  (R-click -> Compile) but only in cases when the build system is
	  already up to date.

	* Source/: cmGlobalVisualStudio8Generator.cxx,
	  cmGlobalVisualStudio8Generator.h: Simplify VS generator
	  ZERO_CHECK dependency

	  The VS generators use a ZERO_CHECK target on which all other
	  targets depend to check whether CMake needs to re-run.  This
	  commit simplifies the addition of a dependency on the target to
	  all other targets.

	  We also move addition of dependencies to the beginning of the
	  Generate step.  This allows the dependency on ZERO_CHECK to be
	  included in the global inter-target dependency analysis.

	  find_package locate packages built in non-standard search
	  locations.

	  The registry explicitly stores locations of build trees providing
	  instances of a given package.  There is no defined order among
	  the locations specified.  These locations should provide package
	  configuration files (<package>-config.cmake) and package version
	  files (<package>-config-version.cmake) so that find_package will
	  recognize the packages and test version numbers.

	  This is a new FortranCInterface.cmake module to replace the
	  previous prototype.  All module support files lie in a
	  FortranCInterface directory next to it.

	  This module uses a new approach to detect Fortran symbol
	  mangling.  We build a single test project which defines symbols
	  in a Fortran library (one per object-file) and calls them from a
	  Fortran executable.  The executable links to a C library which
	  defines symbols encoding all known manglings (one per
	  object-file).  The C library falls back to the Fortran library
	  for symbols it cannot provide.  Therefore the executable will
	  always link, but prefers the C-implemented symbols when they
	  match.  These symbols store string literals of the form
	  INFO:symbol[<name>] so we can parse them out of the executable.

	  This module also provides a simpler interface.  It always detects
	  the mangling as soon as it is included.  A single macro is
	  provided to generate mangling macros and optionally pre-mangled
	  symbols.

	  case that the package to be found was the last one configured in
	  cmake-gui but the current project that is finding it is
	  configured from the command line.

	  We must not allow this when the RPATH string will be replaced

	  This achieves basic process execution on OpenVMS.  We use
	  work-arounds for different fork()/exec() behavior and a lack of
	  select().

	  VMS emulates fork/exec using setjmp/longjmp to evaluate the child
	  and parent return cases from fork.  Therefore both must be
	  invoked from the same function.

	  Since select() works only for sockets we use the BeOS-style
	  polling implementation.  However, non-blocking reads on empty
	  pipes cannot be distinguished easily from the last read on a
	  closed pipe.	Therefore we identify end of data by an empty read
	  after the child terminates.

	  This property was left from before CMake always linked using full

	  link with "-lfoo" we needed to avoid having both shared and
	  static libraries in the build tree for targets that switch on
	  BUILD_SHARED_LIBS.  This meant cleaning both shared and static
	  names before creating the library, which led to the creation of
	  CLEAN_DIRECT_OUTPUT to disable the behavior.

	  Now that we always link with a full path we do not need to clean
	  old library names left from an alternate setting of
	  BUILD_SHARED_LIBS.  This change removes the CLEAN_DIRECT_OUTPUT
	  property and instead uses its behavior always.  It removes some
	  complexity from cmTarget internally.

	  All KWSys C symbol names begin with the KWSYS_NAMESPACE defined
	  at configuration time.  For ease of editing we write canonical
	  names with the prefix 'kwsys' and use macros to map them to the
	  configured prefix at preprocessing time.  In the case of
	  standalone KWSys, the prefix is 'kwsys', so the macros were
	  previously defined to their own names.

	  We now skip defining the macros in the identity case so that the
	  final symbol names are never themselves macros.  This will allow
	  the symbols to be further transformed behind the scenes to help
	  linkers in special cases on some platforms.

	  The add_external_project function separates its arguments with

	  may need to contain a semicolon to form lists in the external

	  This adds add_external_project argument LIST_SEPARATOR to specify
	  a list separator string.  The separator is replaced by ';' in
	  arguments to any command created to drive the external project.
	  For example:

	    add_external_project(...
	      LIST_SEPARATOR ::
	      CMAKE_ARGS -DSOME_LIST:STRING=A::B::C
	      ...)

	  passes "-DSOME_LIST:STRING=A;B;C" to CMake for the external

	  BUG: Fix CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE in macros

	  The value of CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE is supposed to be the list
	  file currently being executed.  Before macros were introduced
	  this was always the context of the argument referencing the
	  variable.

	  Our original implementation of macros replaced the context of
	  command arguments inside the macro with that of the arguments of
	  the calling context.	This worked recursively, but only worked
	  when macros had at least one argument.  Furthermore, it caused
	  parsing errors of the arguments to report the wrong location
	  (calling context instead of line with error).

	  The commit "Improve context for errors in macros" fixed the
	  latter bug by keeping the lexical context of command arguments in
	  macros.  It broke evaluation of CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE because
	  the calling context was no longer preserved in the argument
	  referencing the variable.  However, since our list file
	  processing now maintains the proper value of
	  CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE with dynamic scope we no longer need the
	  context of the argument and can just evaluate the variable
	  normally.

	  A previous change accidentally added the MacOS content directory
	  and Info.plist files created for MACOSX_BUNDLE executables to the
	  list of CMake input files.  This causes CMake to re-generate the
	  project too often.  These items should be added to the list of
	  CMake output files.

	  Alternative fix to bug #8423

	  The patch used to fix this bug used SystemTools::GetRealPath
	  which works only for existing files.	It broke the case of using
	  the command get_filename_component for a non-existing file.
	  Also, it changed long-standing behavior in a possibly
	  incompatible way even for existing files.  This reverts the
	  original fix and instead updates the documentation to be
	  consistent with the behavior.

	  If a logical block terminates with mismatching arguments we

	  the mismatch (return shortly after the ending command).  The

	  the command.	Furthermore, the function blocker would stay in
	  place and complain at the end of every equal-level block of the
	  same type.

	  This teaches CMake to treat the begin/end commands (if/endif,
	  etc.) as correct and just warns when the arguments mismatch.	The
	  change allows cases in which CMake 2.6.2 silently ignored a
	  mismatch to run as before but with a warning.

	  ignored.  It's therefore too late to make this squash apply to

	  today the generator creates linked resources to
	  LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH and EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH if they are not a
	  subdirectory of the binary dir, so that the IDE can detect the
	  Binaries (this was addressed previously as a result of a bug
	  report).

	  Reduces code redundancy by encapsulating common behaviour for
	  LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH and EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH in
	  AppendLinkedResource.

	  Addresses the two new variable names for these locations,
	  CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY and CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
	  respectively.

	  Finally, it is addressing a bug in the current code for relative
	  paths in these variables. If it is a relative path to the binary
	  dir, the IsSubdirectory call returns false and so it creates the
	  linked resource. The created linked resource produces an error in
	  the Eclipse IDE because the IDE expects it to be a full path. The
	  patch now addresses this by concatenating the binary dir if it is
	  a relative path.

	  FIND_PATH.  Previously the test for one version would find an
	  unversioned system boost even when the user set BOOST_ROOT (since
	  the NO_DEFAULT_PATH option is not used).  See issue #7456.

	  When looking for NOTFOUND libraries, use the direct dependencies

	  When creating an IMPORTED target for a library that has been

	  important to allow per-configuration files to be specified for
	  the library.

	  This change creates an UNKNOWN type for IMPORTED library targets.
	   The IMPORTED_LOCATION property (and its per-config equivalents)
	  specifies the location of the library.  CMake makes no
	  assumptions about the library that cannot be inferred from the
	  file on disk.  This will help projects and find-modules import
	  targets found on disk or specified by the user.

	  When an executable target within the project is named in

	  not a circular depenency.

	* Source/cmSourceFileLocation.cxx: ENH: Recognize src extensions of

	  For historical reasons we still support naming of source files
	  without their extension.  Sources without known extensions are
	  located on disk by iterating through a fixed set of possible
	  extensions.  We now want users to always specify the extension,
	  so the fixed set will not be expanded and is preserved for
	  compatibility with older projects.

	  languages to avoid checking the disk for files whose extensions
	  are unambiguous but not in the original fixed set.

	* Source/: cmComputeLinkDepends.cxx, cmComputeLinkDepends.h,
	  cmComputeLinkInformation.cxx: BUG: Preserve all non-targets on
	  user link lines

	  In CMake 2.4 the generated link line for a target always
	  preserved the originally specified libraries in their original
	  order.  Dependencies were satisfied by inserting extra libraries
	  into the line, though it had some bugs.  In CMake 2.6.0 we
	  preserved only the items on the link line that are not known to
	  be shared libraries.	This reduced excess libraries on the link
	  line.  However, since we link to system libraries (such as
	  /usr/lib/libm.so) by asking the linker to search (-lm), some
	  linkers secretly replace the library with a static library in
	  another implicit search directory (developers can override this
	  by using an imported target to force linking by full path).  When
	  this happens the order still matters.

	  To avoid this and other potential subtle issues this commit
	  restores preservation of all non-target items and static library
	  targets.  This will create cases of unnecessary, duplicate shared
	  libraries on the link line if the user specifies them, but at
	  least it will work.  In the future we can attempt a more advanced
	  analysis to safely remove duplicate shared libraries from the
	  link line.

	* Source/cmComputeLinkDepends.cxx: BUG: Preserve shared lib order
	  for 2.4 compatibility

	  We preserve the order and multiplicity of libraries directly
	  linked by a target as specified by the user.	Items known to be
	  shared libraries may be safely skipped because order preservation
	  is only needed for static libraries.	However, CMake 2.4 did not
	  skip shared libs, so we do the same when in 2.4 compatibility
	  mode.

	    - The source-file signature of try_compile looks up the
	  language
	      of the source file using the extension-to-language map so
	  that
	      it knows what language to enable in the generated project.
	    - This map needs to be filled before loading a file specified
	  by
		CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE
		CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE_<LANG>
	      so that the user file may call the try_compile() source-file
	      signature.
	    - It must still be re-filled after loading
	  CMake<LANG>Information.cmake

	  the CPack components functionality from Doug Gregor.

	  Details: ==========

	   - New cpack_add_component, cpack_add_component_group, and
	  cpack_add_install_type "commands" defined as macros in the CPack
	  module.   - Documentation for all of the variables and commands
	  in the CPack module.	 - Added get_cmake_property(... COMPONENTS)
	  to CMake to ask for the  names of all components. Used in the
	  CPack module to automatically build component-based installers.
	  (Set CPACK_MONOLITHIC_INSTALL to turn off component-based
	  installation).   - A group can declare its PARENT_GROUP, to build
	  an arbitrary	hierarchy of groups.   - New CPack command
	  cpack_configure_downloads, which creates an  installer that
	  downloads only the selected components on-the-fly.  Those
	  components marked DOWNLOADED will be separate packages downloaded
	  on-the-fly (or, all packages can be marked as such with the ALL
	  option to cpack_configure_downloads). Individual components are
	  compressed with ZIP at installer-creation time and
	  downloaded/uncompressed by the installer as needed. This feature
	  is only available on Windows with NSIS at the moment.   - NSIS
	  installers can install themselves and enable the "Change"  button
	  in Add/Remove programs, allowing users to go back and install or
	  remove components. This can be disabled through
	  cpack_configure_downloads, because it's only really useful is
	  most of the application's functionality is in downloaded
	  components.	- Bug fix: automatically install everything whose
	  COMPONENT was not  specified (it's a hidden, required group)	-
	  Bug fix: fixed removal of components when re-running the NSIS
	  installer and unchecking components  - Bug fix: NSIS installers
	  now only install/remove the minimal number of files when re-run
	  to update the installation (or by clicking "Change" in Add/Remove
	  programs)

	  BUG: Fix Xcode reference to Info.plist resource

	    - Generated Xcode projects for application bundles list the
	      CMake-generated Info.plist input file as a resource.
	    - The location of the input file was moved by a previous
	  commit,
	      but the reference to it as a resource file was not updated.
	    - This change moves the file to CMakeFiles/<tgt>.dir/Info.plist
	      to give it a more intuitive name in the Xcode project.
	    - We also update the reference to point at the correct
	  location.
	    - See bug #7277.

	* Source/cmGlobalXCodeGenerator.cxx: BUG: Fix Xcode per-config
	  bundle name in Info.plist

	    - The Xcode generator creates one Info.plist input file which
	  is
	      converted at build time by Xcode and placed in the final
	  bundle.
	    - The <CONFIG>_OUTPUT_NAME target property can place different
	  content
	      for the exe name in Info.plist on a per-configuration basis.
	    - Instead of generating a per-config Info.plist input file just
	  let
	      Xcode put the name in at build time using the
	  $(EXECUTABLE_NAME) var.

	  Cleanup Find* modules with new HINTS feature

	    - The find_* commands now provide a HINTS option.
	    - The option specifies paths to be preferred over the system
	  paths.
	    - Many Find* modules were using two find calls with
	  NO_DEFAULT_PATH
	      to approximate the behavior, but that blocked users from
	  overriding
	      things with CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.
	    - This commit uses the HINTS feature to get desired behavior in
	      only one find command call.

	* Source/: cmFindBase.cxx, cmFindPackageCommand.cxx: ENH: Make

	    - The CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH and similar variables have both
	      environment and CMake cache versions.
	    - Previously the environment value was checked before the
	      cache value.
	    - Now the cache value is favored because it is more specific.

	    - Hints are searched after user locations but before system
	  locations
	    - The HINTS option should have paths provided by system
	  introspection
	    - The PATHS option should have paths that are hard-coded

2008-06-09 12:51  king

	* Source/cmFindPathCommand.cxx: ENH: Improve framework search speed
	  for find_file and find_path

	    - Locating a header inside a framework often requires globbing
	    - Previously the glob was <dir>/*/Headers/<name>
	    - Now the glob is <dir>/*.framework/Headers/<name>
	    - This is much faster when <dir> is not really a framework dir

	  find_* command framework/appbundle search order impl.

	    - CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK and CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE are supposed to
	  specify
	      whether to find frameworks/appbundles FIRST, LAST, ONLY, or
	  NEVER.
	    - Previously this affected only the placement of
	  CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH
	      and CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH with respect to the other path
	  specifiers.
	    - Now it behaves as documented.  The entire search path is
	  inspected for
	      each kind of program, library, or header before trying the
	  next kind.
	    - Additionally the ONLY mode is now honored for headers so that
	  users
	      do not end up with a library in framework and a header from
	  elsewhere.

	      between cmFindBase and cmFindPackageCommand.
	    - Expand user path registry values up in cmFindCommon
	      - Enables 32-/64-bit registry view for find_package

	  ENH: Remove SKIP_RULE_DEPENDS option from add_custom_command()

	    - Option was recently added but never released.
	    - Custom commands no longer depend on build.make so we do
	      not need the option.
	    - Rule hashes now take care of rebuilding when rules change
	      so the dependency is not needed.

2008-06-02 16:44  king

	* Source/: cmGlobalGenerator.cxx, cmGlobalGenerator.h,
	  cmMakefileTargetGenerator.cxx: ENH: Introduce "rule hashes" to
	  help rebuild files when rules change.

	    - In CMake 2.4 custom commands would not rebuild when rules
	  changed.
	    - In CMake 2.6.0 custom commands have a dependency on
	  build.make
	      which causes them to rebuild when changed, but also when any
	      source is added or removed.  This is too often.
	    - We cannot have a per-rule file because Windows filesystems
	      do not deal well with lots of small files.
	    - Instead we add a persistent CMakeFiles/CMakeRuleHashes.txt
	  file
	      at the top of the build tree that is updated during each
	      CMake Generate step.  It records a hash of the build rule for
	      each file to be built.  When the hash changes the file is
	      removed so that it will be rebuilt.

	* Source/kwsys/CMakeLists.txt: ENH: In KWSys set the
	  IMPLICIT_DEPENDS_INCLUDE_TRANSFORM property.

	    - Tells CMake about the KWSYS_HEADER macro.
	    - Enables implicit dependencies of private source files.
	    - When a CMake new enough to support the property is required
	      the "#if 0" hack can be removed from the source files.

	    - Allows make rules to be created with no dependencies.
	    - Such rules will not re-run even if the commands themselves

	* Source/: cmGlobalGenerator.cxx, cmGlobalGenerator.h,

	    - Previously this was done implicitly by the check for a target
	      link language which checked all source full paths.
	    - The recent change to support computing a link language
	  without
	      finding all the source files skipped the implicit check.
	    - This change adds an explicit check to find all source files.

	* Source/cmake.cxx: BUG: make "cmake -Wno-dev ../srcdir" work,
	  advancing i had the effect that the argument after -Wno-dev was
	  skipped, which happened to be the source directory, and so the
	  current working directory was assumed as source directory,

	  almost exactly reverted back to the state when CURSES_LIBRARY and
	  CURSES_INCLUDE_PATH where set for compatibility but not in the
	  cache. It is important that CURSES_CURSES_LIBRARY and
	  CURSES_NCURSES_LIBRARY really contain the path to these files.
	  Later on CURSES_LIBRARY is set to the one of the two which will
	  be used as curses library. This is now done in the cache, without
	  FORCE.  So preloading the cache still seems to work (at least
	  what I tested).

	  If the RPATH in the build tree file is to short, it is padded
	  using the separator character.  This is currently disabled by
	  default, it can be enabled using the option CMAKE_USE_CHRPATH.
	  There are additional checks whether it is safe to enable it. I
	  will rework them and use FILE(READ) instead to detect whether the

	  This change should be backward compatible: if there is a project
	  using fortran and CXX, they had to set the LINKER_LANGUAGE
	  explicitely, otherwise cmake complained (but still generated the
	  project files). Explicitely setting the linker language still
	  overrides automatic detection.  If somebody has a custom language
	  for cmake and the PREFERENCE starts with "P", its changed to 100,
	  which gives it preference over all other languages (except the
	  other custom languages which have also "Prefered"). "None" is
	  converted to 0.

	  CMake-SourceFile2-b-mp1 to trunk.  This commit is surrounded by
	  tags CMake-SourceFile2-b-mp1-pre and CMake-SourceFile2-b-mp1-post
	  on the trunk.

	  The changes re-implement cmSourceFile and the use of it to allow
	  instances to be created much earlier.  The use of
	  cmSourceFileLocation allows locating a source file referenced by
	  a user to be much simpler and more robust.  The two SetName
	  methods are no longer needed so some duplicate code has been
	  removed.  The strange "SourceName" stuff is gone.  Code that
	  created cmSourceFile instances on the stack and then sent them to
	  cmMakefile::AddSource has been simplified and converted to
	  getting cmSourceFile instances from cmMakefile.  The CPluginAPI
	  has preserved the old API through a compatibility interface.

	  Source lists are gone.  Targets now get real instances of
	  cmSourceFile right away instead of storing a list of strings
	  until the final pass.

	  TraceVSDependencies has been re-written to avoid the use of
	  SourceName.  It is now called TraceDependencies since it is not
	  just for VS.	It is now implemented with a helper object which
	  makes the code simpler.

	  set or preset by the user. It has now also two new arguments:
	  RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE and COMPILE_OUTPUT_VARIABLE (the old
	  OUTPUT_VARIABLE merges both), so if only COMPILE_OUTPUT_VARIABLE
	  is used the run time output of the TRY_RUN is unused and the user
	  doesn't have to care about the output when crosscompiling. This
	  is now used in FindThreads.cmake, CheckC/CXXSourceRuns.cmake and
	  TestBigEndian.cmake, which used the output only for the logfile
	  (compile output is still there). Test/TryCompile/ now also tests
	  the behaviour of OUTPUT_VARIABLE, RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE and

	* Modules/CMakeDetermineCompilerId.cmake, Source/cmFileCommand.cxx,
	  Source/cmFileCommand.h:
	  ENH: add option to FILE(STRINGS NO_HEX_CONVERSION) to disable
	  automatic conversion of hex and srec files to binary.  Without
	  this automatic conversion, everywhere where a compiled file is
	  parsed for strings the a file(HEX2BIN somefile binfile) command
	  has to be added otherwise it will not work for these compilers. I
	  tried this with DetermineCompiler and CheckTypeSize and nobody
	  will do this except the users who work with such compilers. For
	  them it will break if they don't add this conversion command in
	  all these places.  If FILE(STRINGS) is used with a text file, it
	  will in most cases still work as expected, since it will only
	  convert hex and srec files. If a user actually wants to get text
	  out of hex files, he knows what he's doing and will see the hint
	  in the documentation.

	  Anyway, it should work without having to create a temporary file,
	  will work on this later.

	  first (very incomplete) step to support MS crosscompiling tools
	  -remove stdio.h from the simple C program which checks if the
	  compiler works, since this may not exist for some embedded
	  platforms -create a new CMakeFindBinUtils.cmake which collects
	  the search fro ar, ranlib, strip, ld, link, install_name_tool and
	  other tools like these -add support for CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH for
	  all FIND_XXX commands, which is a list of directories which will
	  be prepended to all search directories, right now as a cmake
	  variable, turning it into a global cmake property may need some

	  -split cmFileCommand::HandleInstall() into slightly smaller
	  functions

	  configurable via the CMAKE_STRIP_FILE rule, currently only
	  implemented for the GNU toolchain.  Now cpack should work also
	  for cross compiling (since it doesn't have to know the executable
	  suffix anymore).

	  stripping can be enabled/disabled via the cache variable
	  CMAKE_INSTALL_DO_STRIP.

	  Even if this is disabled, the cmake_install.cmake files still
	  contain the strip rules, so by running cmake
	  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_DO_STRIP=1 cmake_install.cmake you can install
	  with stripping also in this case.

	  compilers will be searched only there, the other tools at first
	  there, after that in other locations

	  If not already defined, both of them will be set by
	  CMakeDetermineXXXCompiler.cmake and used by the other one. If

	  file-level custom commands to drive them.  This bug was
	  introduced by the "fix" to bug 4377.	This also restores the
	  documented behavior that PRE_BUILD rules are treated as PRE_LINK
	  rules on non-VS generators.  Also fixed custom command
	  dependencies on the rule file build.make so that custom commands
	  re-run when the commands themselves change.

	  directory could exceed the filesystem limit.	Now CMake
	  recognizes this case and replaces enough of the beginning of the
	  full path to the source file with an md5sum of the replaced
	  portion to make the name fit on disk.  This addresses bug#4520.

	  considered primary and has the build rule attached.  Other
	  outputs simply depend on the first output with no build rule.
	  During cmake_check_build_system CMake detects when a secondary
	  output is missing and removes the primary output to make sure all
	  outputs are regenerated.  This approach always builds the custom
	  command at the right time and only once even during parallel
	  builds.

	  source and binary directories are added automatically to the
	  beginning of the include path in every directory.  This simulates
	  in-source behavior for double-quote includes when there are
	  generated sources and headers in the directory.

	  changes to cleanup computation of target names.  This should fix
	  many bugs related to target names being computed inconsistently.

	  - Centralized computation of a target's file name to a method in
	   cmTarget.  Now that global knowledge is always available the
	  *_CMAKE_PATH cache variables are no longer needed.

	  - Centralized computation of link library command lines and link
	   directory search order.

	  - Moved computation of link directories needed to link CMake
	  targets   to be after evaluation of linking dependencies.

	  This also removed alot of duplicate code in which each version
	  had its own bugs.

	  This commit is surrounded by the tags

	    CMake-TargetNameCentralization1-pre

	  and

	    CMake-TargetNameCentralization1-post

	  so make the large set of changes easy to identify.

2004-06-15 11:52  king

	* Source/cmLocalUnixMakefileGenerator.cxx: Removing automatic
	  addition of a -I path for the current source directory.  This is
	  not consistent with the Visual Studio generators which do not
	  provide this path.  It should not be added anyway because it is
	  adding an include path not requested by the CMakeLists.txt code.
	  The code I'm removing was originally added in revision 1.17 of
	  cmUnixMakefileGenerator.cxx as a part of several other changes
	  and has a commit log entry of

	    "some bug fixes"

	  It was propagated from their to cmLocalUnixMakefileGenerator.cxx.
	   Since all our projects build in the VS IDE without this include
	  path, it should not be needed.  Users can easily fix problems
	  caused by this by adding

	    INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR})

	  to their CMakeLists.txt code.  This was often necessary
	  previously when a project was originally written on a Unix system
	  and then built with Visual Studio.

	  This involved splitting cmTarget::INSTALL into INSTALL_FILES and
	  INSTALL_PROGRAMS enum values.  INSTALL_FILES no longer adds
	  execute permission.  The INSTALL_PROGRAMS commnad takes either a
	  list of explicit names, or a regex.  It will not expand source
