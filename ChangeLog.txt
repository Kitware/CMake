	  chrpath is handled very similar to install_name_tool on the mac.
	  If the RPATH in the build tree file is to short, it is padded
	  using the separator character.  This is currently disabled by
	  default, it can be enabled using the option CMAKE_USE_CHRPATH.
	  There are additional checks whether it is safe to enable it. I
	  will rework them and use FILE(READ) instead to detect whether the

	  automake choses:
	  http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/How-the-Linker-is-Chosen.html

	  This change should be backward compatible: if there is a project
	  using fortran and CXX, they had to set the LINKER_LANGUAGE
	  explicitely, otherwise cmake complained (but still generated the
	  project files). Explicitely setting the linker language still
	  overrides automatic detection.  If somebody has a custom language
	  for cmake and the PREFERENCE starts with "P", its changed to 100,
	  which gives it preference over all other languages (except the
	  other custom languages which have also "Prefered"). "None" is
	  converted to 0.

	  branch CMake-SourceFile2-b between tags CMake-SourceFile2-bp and
	  CMake-SourceFile2-b-mp1 to trunk.  This commit is surrounded by
	  tags CMake-SourceFile2-b-mp1-pre and CMake-SourceFile2-b-mp1-post
	  on the trunk.

	  The changes re-implement cmSourceFile and the use of it to allow
	  instances to be created much earlier.  The use of
	  cmSourceFileLocation allows locating a source file referenced by
	  a user to be much simpler and more robust.  The two SetName
	  methods are no longer needed so some duplicate code has been
	  removed.  The strange "SourceName" stuff is gone.  Code that
	  created cmSourceFile instances on the stack and then sent them to
	  cmMakefile::AddSource has been simplified and converted to
	  getting cmSourceFile instances from cmMakefile.  The CPluginAPI
	  has preserved the old API through a compatibility interface.

	  Source lists are gone.  Targets now get real instances of
	  cmSourceFile right away instead of storing a list of strings
	  until the final pass.

	  TraceVSDependencies has been re-written to avoid the use of
	  SourceName.  It is now called TraceDependencies since it is not
	  just for VS.	It is now implemented with a helper object which
	  makes the code simpler.

	  is now used in FindThreads.cmake, CheckC/CXXSourceRuns.cmake and

	  ENH: add option to FILE(STRINGS NO_HEX_CONVERSION) to disable
	  automatic conversion of hex and srec files to binary.  Without
	  this automatic conversion, everywhere where a compiled file is
	  parsed for strings the a file(HEX2BIN somefile binfile) command
	  has to be added otherwise it will not work for these compilers. I
	  tried this with DetermineCompiler and CheckTypeSize and nobody
	  will do this except the users who work with such compilers. For
	  them it will break if they don't add this conversion command in
	  all these places.  If FILE(STRINGS) is used with a text file, it
	  will in most cases still work as expected, since it will only
	  convert hex and srec files. If a user actually wants to get text
	  out of hex files, he knows what he's doing and will see the hint
	  in the documentation.

	  Anyway, it should work without having to create a temporary file,
	  will work on this later.

	  if they have a different suffix because they are probably
	  crosscompiled, but nevertheless it should be able to find them

	  toolchains (arm-elf-gcc, arm-elf-ar, arm-elf-strip etc.) -move
	  ranlib on OSX from the file command to a command in executed in
	  cmake_install.cmake -add support for stripping during install in

	  first (very incomplete) step to support MS crosscompiling tools
	  -remove stdio.h from the simple C program which checks if the
	  compiler works, since this may not exist for some embedded
	  platforms -create a new CMakeFindBinUtils.cmake which collects
	  the search fro ar, ranlib, strip, ld, link, install_name_tool and
	  other tools like these -add support for CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH for
	  all FIND_XXX commands, which is a list of directories which will
	  be prepended to all search directories, right now as a cmake
	  variable, turning it into a global cmake property may need some

	  -split cmFileCommand::HandleInstall() into slightly smaller
	  functions

2007-05-01 14:23  alex

	* Modules/: CMakeDetermineCCompiler.cmake,
	  CMakeDetermineCXXCompiler.cmake:
	  ENH: add two new variables: CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX: will be
	  prepended to gcc, ar, g++, cc, c++ and ranlib if defined (gives
	  e.g. arm-elf-gcc etc.) CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_LOCATION: if defined, the
	  compilers will be searched only there, the other tools at first
	  there, after that in other locations

	  If not already defined, both of them will be set by
	  CMakeDetermineXXXCompiler.cmake and used by the other one. If
	  mixing the environment variable CC/CXX and these variables this
	  can give weird mixtures.

	  change order of compiler names for CXX: from c++, g++ to g++, c++
	  (same order as for C)

	* Source/: cmMakefileExecutableTargetGenerator.cxx,
	  cmMakefileLibraryTargetGenerator.cxx,
	  cmMakefileTargetGenerator.cxx, cmMakefileTargetGenerator.h,
	  cmMakefileUtilityTargetGenerator.cxx: BUG: A utility target
	  should not run the custom commands from its source files
	  directly.  The target-level rule must add dependencies on the
	  file-level custom commands to drive them.  This bug was
	  introduced by the "fix" to bug 4377.	This also restores the
	  documented behavior that PRE_BUILD rules are treated as PRE_LINK
	  rules on non-VS generators.  Also fixed custom command
	  dependencies on the rule file build.make so that custom commands
	  re-run when the commands themselves change.

	  with a long full path.  The object file name previously would
	  contain the entire path which when combined with the build output
	  directory could exceed the filesystem limit.	Now CMake
	  recognizes this case and replaces enough of the beginning of the
	  full path to the source file with an md5sum of the replaced
	  portion to make the name fit on disk.  This addresses bug#4520.

	  changes to cleanup computation of target names.  This should fix
	  many bugs related to target names being computed inconsistently.

	  - Centralized computation of a target's file name to a method in
	   cmTarget.  Now that global knowledge is always available the
	  *_CMAKE_PATH cache variables are no longer needed.

	  - Centralized computation of link library command lines and link
	   directory search order.

	  - Moved computation of link directories needed to link CMake
	  targets   to be after evaluation of linking dependencies.

	  This also removed alot of duplicate code in which each version
	  had its own bugs.

	  This commit is surrounded by the tags

	    CMake-TargetNameCentralization1-pre

	  and

	    CMake-TargetNameCentralization1-post

	  so make the large set of changes easy to identify.

2004-06-15 11:52  king

	* Source/cmLocalUnixMakefileGenerator.cxx: Removing automatic
	  addition of a -I path for the current source directory.  This is
	  not consistent with the Visual Studio generators which do not
	  provide this path.  It should not be added anyway because it is
	  adding an include path not requested by the CMakeLists.txt code.
	  The code I'm removing was originally added in revision 1.17 of
	  cmUnixMakefileGenerator.cxx as a part of several other changes
	  and has a commit log entry of

	    "some bug fixes"

	  It was propagated from their to cmLocalUnixMakefileGenerator.cxx.
	   Since all our projects build in the VS IDE without this include
	  path, it should not be needed.  Users can easily fix problems
	  caused by this by adding

	    INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR})

	  to their CMakeLists.txt code.  This was often necessary
	  previously when a project was originally written on a Unix system
	  and then built with Visual Studio.

	  cmDSPWriter.cxx, cmMakeDepend.cxx, cmMakefile.cxx, cmMakefile.h,
	  cmUnixMakefileGenerator.cxx: BUG: Changed include and link
	  directory paths in cmMakefile back to std::vector because there

	  inserted.
