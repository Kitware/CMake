# Rules for where jobs can run

###
## Job variables:
##   CMAKE_CI_JOB_UPDATES_VERSION
##     Set to "true" if the job performs a task that occurs with version
##     updates.
##   CMAKE_CI_JOB_UPDATES_WEBSITE_HELP
##     Set to "true" if the job performs tasks to update website help.
##   CMAKE_CI_JOB_PACKAGE_ONLY
##     Set to "true" if the job handles packaging tasks. These jobs will only
##     run during packaging pipelines.
## Pipeline variables:
##   CMAKE_CI_VERSION_UPDATE
##     Set to "true" if the pipeline should perform version update tasks.
##     No other tasks are performed if set.
##   CMAKE_CI_PACKAGE
##     Set to either "dev" or `vX.Y` to construct a packaging pipeline. Also
##     uploads constructed packages. May also run website help jobs. No other
##     tasks are performed if set.
## Project variables:
##   CMAKE_CI_PROJECT_MAIN_BRANCH
##     Set to the name of the main integration branch where development
##     version documentation pipelines run.
##   CMAKE_CI_PROJECT_CONTINUOUS_BRANCH
##     Set to the name of the staging branch where continuous pipelines run.
