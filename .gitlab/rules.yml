# Rules for where jobs can run

###
## Job variables:
##   CMAKE_CI_JOB_UPDATES_VERSION
##     Set to "true" if the job performs a task that occurs with version
##     updates.
## Pipeline variables:
##   CMAKE_CI_VERSION_UPDATE
##     Set to "true" if the pipeline should perform version update tasks.
##     No other tasks are performed if set.
