CMake Error in CMakeLists.txt:
  export called with target "exported" which requires target "doubleexported"
  that is not in this export set, but in multiple other export sets:
  .*/Tests/RunCMake/export/DependOnDoubleExport-build/exportset.cmake,
  .*/Tests/RunCMake/export/DependOnDoubleExport-build/manual.cmake.
+
  An exported target cannot depend upon another target which is exported
  multiple times.  Consider consolidating the exports of the "doubleexported"
  target to a single export.


CMake Generate step failed.  Build files cannot be regenerated correctly.
