CMake Warning \(dev\) at CMP0084-NEW\.cmake:[0-9]+ \(find_package\):
  FindQt\.cmake must either be part of this project itself, in this case
  adjust CMAKE_MODULE_PATH so that it points to the correct location inside
  its source tree\.

  Or it must be installed by a package which has already been found via
  find_package\(\)\.  In this case make sure that package has indeed been found
  and adjust CMAKE_MODULE_PATH to contain the location where that package has
  installed FindQt\.cmake\.  This must be a location provided by that package\.
  This error in general means that the buildsystem of this project is relying
  on a Find-module without ensuring that it is actually available\.
