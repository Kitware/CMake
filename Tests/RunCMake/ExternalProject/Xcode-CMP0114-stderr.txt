^CMake Warning \(dev\) at .*/Modules/ExternalProject.cmake:[0-9]+ \(message\):
  Policy CMP0114 is not set to NEW.  In order to support the Xcode "new build
  system", this project must be updated to set policy CMP0114 to NEW.

  Since CMake is generating for the Xcode "new build system",
  ExternalProject_Add will use policy CMP0114's NEW behavior anyway, but the
  generated build system may not match what the project intends.
