CMake Error at .*/Modules/Documentation.cmake:[0-9]+ \(message\):
  Documentation.cmake is VTK-specific code and should not be used in non-VTK
  projects.  This logic in this module is best shipped with the project using
  it rather than with CMake.  This is now an error according to policy
  CMP0106.
