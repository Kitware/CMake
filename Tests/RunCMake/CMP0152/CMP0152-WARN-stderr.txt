^CMake Warning \(dev\) at CMP0152-Common\.cmake:[0-9]+ \(file\):
  Policy CMP0152 is not set: file\(REAL_PATH\) resolves symlinks before
  collapsing \.\./ components\.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0152" for policy
  details\.  Use the cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this
  warning\.

  From input path:

  [^
]*/Tests/RunCMake/CMP0152/CMP0152-WARN-build/dir/bin/\.\./

  the policy OLD behavior produces path:

  [^
]*/Tests/RunCMake/CMP0152/CMP0152-WARN-build/dir

  but the policy NEW behavior produces path:

  [^
]*/Tests/RunCMake/CMP0152/CMP0152-WARN-build/dir/nested

  Since the policy is not set, CMake is using the OLD behavior for
  compatibility.
