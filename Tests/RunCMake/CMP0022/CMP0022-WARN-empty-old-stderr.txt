^CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:1 \(cmake_minimum_required\):
  Compatibility with CMake < 2.8.12 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
  CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.

CMake Warning \(dev\) in CMakeLists.txt:
  Policy CMP0022 is not set: INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES defines the link
  interface.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0022" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  Target "bar" has an INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property.  This should be
  preferred as the source of the link interface for this library but because
  CMP0022 is not set CMake is ignoring the property and using the link
  implementation as the link interface instead.

  INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES:

    foo

  Link implementation:

    \(empty\)

This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
