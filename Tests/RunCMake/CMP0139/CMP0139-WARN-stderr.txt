CMake Warning \(dev\) at CMP0139-WARN.cmake:[0-9]+ \(if\):
  Policy CMP0139 is not set: The if\(\) command supports path comparisons using
  PATH_EQUAL operator.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0139" for policy details.
  Use the cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  PATH_EQUAL will be interpreted as an operator when the policy is set to
  NEW.  Since the policy is not set the OLD behavior will be used.
