CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists\.txt:[0-9]+ \(cmake_minimum_required\):
  The OLD behavior for policy CMP0052 will be removed from a future version
  of CMake\.

  The cmake-policies\(7\) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
  policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
  specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
  behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.$
