^(CMake Warning:
  You are using Visual Studio tools for Android, which does not support
  standalone executables\.  However, the following executable targets do not
  have the ANDROID_GUI property set, and thus will not be built as expected\.
  They will be built as shared libraries with executable filenames:

    android_c, android_cxx, android_sysinc_c, android_sysinc_cxx)?$
