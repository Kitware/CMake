CMake Error: Unable to \(re\)create the private pkgRedirects directory:
  [^
]*/Tests/RunCMake/Configure/ReadOnly-build/CMakeFiles/pkgRedirects
This may be caused by not having read/write access to the build directory.
Try specifying a location with read/write access like:
  cmake -B build
If using a CMake presets file, ensure that preset parameter
'binaryDir' expands to a writable directory.
