^CMake Warning \(dev\) in CMakeLists\.txt:
  No project\(\) command is present.  The top-level CMakeLists.txt file must
  contain a literal, direct call to the project\(\) command.  Add a line of
  code such as

    project\(ProjectName\)

  near the top of the file, but after cmake_minimum_required\(\).

  CMake is pretending there is a "project\(Project\)" command on the first
  line\.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it\.
+
CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists\.txt:1 \(cmake_minimum_required\):
  Compatibility with CMake < 3\.5 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake\.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a \.\.\.<max> suffix to tell
  CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions\.$
