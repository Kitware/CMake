^CMake Warning \(dev\) in CMakeLists.txt:
  No project\(\) command is present.  The top-level CMakeLists.txt file must
  contain a literal, direct call to the project\(\) command.  Add a line of
  code such as

    project\(ProjectName\)

  near the top of the file, but after cmake_minimum_required\(\).

  CMake is pretending there is a "project\(Project\)" command on the first
  line.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.$
