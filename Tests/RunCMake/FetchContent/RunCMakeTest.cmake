# We need to pass through CMAKE_GENERATOR and CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM
# to ensure the test can run on machines where the build tool
# isn't on the PATH. Some build slaves explicitly test with such
# an arrangement (e.g. to test with spaces in the path). We also
# pass through the platform and toolset for completeness, even
# though we don't build anything, just in case this somehow affects
# the way the build tool is invoked.
