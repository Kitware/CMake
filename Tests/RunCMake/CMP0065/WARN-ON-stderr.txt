CMake Warning \(dev\) in CMakeLists.txt:
  Policy CMP0065 is not set: Do not add flags to export symbols from
  executables without the ENABLE_EXPORTS target property.  Run "cmake
  --help-policy CMP0065" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy command to
  set the policy and suppress this warning.

  For compatibility with older versions of CMake, additional flags may be
  added to export symbols on all executables regardless of thier
  ENABLE_EXPORTS property.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
