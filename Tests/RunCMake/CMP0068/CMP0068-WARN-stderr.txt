CMake Warning \(dev\):
  Policy CMP0068 is not set: RPATH settings on macOS do not affect
  install_name.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0068" for policy details.  Use
  the cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  For compatibility with older versions of CMake, the install_name fields for
  the following targets are still affected by RPATH settings:

   foo3
   foo4

This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
