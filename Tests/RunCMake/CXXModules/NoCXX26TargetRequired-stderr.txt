CMake Error in CMakeLists\.txt:
  The "CXX_MODULE_STD" property on target "nocxx26target" requires toolchain
  support, but it was not provided.  Reason:

    (Toolchain does not support discovering module metadata|Experimental `import std` support not enabled when detecting toolchain; it must be set before `CXX` is enabled \(usually a `project\(\)` call\)|Unsupported generator: [^\n]*)
