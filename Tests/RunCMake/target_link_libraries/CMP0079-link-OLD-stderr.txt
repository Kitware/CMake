^CMake Deprecation Warning at CMP0079-link-OLD.cmake:[0-9]+ \(cmake_policy\):
  The OLD behavior for policy CMP0079 will be removed from a future version
  of CMake.

  The cmake-policies\(7\) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
  policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
  specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
  behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.

CMake Error at CMP0079-link/CMakeLists.txt:[0-9]+ \(target_link_libraries\):
  Attempt to add link library "foo" to target "top" which is not built in
  this directory.

  This is allowed only when policy CMP0079 is set to NEW.$
