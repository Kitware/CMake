CMake Warning \(dev\) at CMP0067.cmake:[0-9]+ \(try_compile\):
  Policy CMP0067 is not set: Honor language standard in try_compile\(\)
  source-file signature.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0067" for policy
  details.  Use the cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this
  warning.

  For compatibility with older versions of CMake, try_compile is not honoring
  language standard variables in the test project:

    CMAKE_C_STANDARD

CMake Deprecation Warning at CMP0067.cmake:[0-9]+ \(cmake_policy\):
  The OLD behavior for policy CMP0067 will be removed from a future version
  of CMake.

  The cmake-policies\(7\) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
  policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
  specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
  behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.
