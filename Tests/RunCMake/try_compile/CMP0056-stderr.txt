CMake Warning \(dev\) at CMP0056.cmake:[0-9]+ \(try_compile\):
  Policy CMP0056 is not set: Honor link flags in try_compile\(\) source-file
  signature.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0056" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  For compatibility with older versions of CMake, try_compile is not honoring
  caller link flags \(e.g.  CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS\) in the test project.

This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Deprecation Warning at CMP0056.cmake:[0-9]+ \(cmake_policy\):
  The OLD behavior for policy CMP0056 will be removed from a future version
  of CMake.

  The cmake-policies\(7\) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
  policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
  specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
  behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.
