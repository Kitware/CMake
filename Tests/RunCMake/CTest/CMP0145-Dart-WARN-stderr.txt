CMake Deprecation Warning at [^
]*/Modules/Dart\.cmake:[0-9]+6 \(cmake_policy\):
  The OLD behavior for policy CMP0145 will be removed from a future version
  of CMake\.

  The cmake-policies\(7\) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
  policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
  specific short-term circumstances\.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
  behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD\.
