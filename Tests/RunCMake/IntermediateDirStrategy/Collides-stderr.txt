CMake Warning in collides/CMakeLists.txt:
  The 'CubeTestPluginLogic' and 'TeamworkServerBlobStoreUploadSessionStore'
  targets share an intermediate directory

      .*/Tests/RunCMake/IntermediateDirStrategy/Collides-build/(collides/)?.o/039c43fd

  which may cause problems with the build graph.  This project is not
  compatible with the `SHORT` target intermediate directory strategy.
  Possible remedies include: moving the target into different directories or
  renaming a target.
