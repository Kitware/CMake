CMake Warning \(dev\) at CMP0140-WARN.cmake:[0-9]+ \(return\):
  Policy CMP0140 is not set: The return\(\) command checks its arguments.  Run
  "cmake --help-policy CMP0140" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy
  command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  return\(\) checks its arguments when the policy is set to NEW.  Since the
  policy is not set the OLD behavior will be used so the arguments will be
  ignored.
