# Adding Support for a Dashboard #

Adding support for submitting our test results to a dashboard is very easy. We
already defined a number of tests for our project in the earlier steps of this
tutorial. We just have to run those tests and submit them to a dashboard. To
include support for dashboards we include the CTest module in our top-level
CMakeLists.txt.

Replace:
  # enable testing
  enable_testing()

With:
  # enable dashboard scripting
  include(CTest)

The CTest module will automatically call enable_testing(), so
we can remove it from our CMake files.

We will also need to create a CTestConfig.cmake file where we can specify the
name of the project and where to submit the dashboard.

  set(CTEST_PROJECT_NAME "CMakeTutorial")
  set(CTEST_NIGHTLY_START_TIME "01:00:00 UTC")

  set(CTEST_DROP_METHOD "http")
  set(CTEST_DROP_SITE "my.cdash.org/")
  set(CTEST_DROP_LOCATION "/submit.php?project=CMakeTutorial")
  set(CTEST_DROP_SITE_CDASH TRUE)

CTest will read in this file when it runs. To create a simple dashboard you can
run cmake or cmake-gui to configure the project, but do not build it yet.
Instead, change directory to the binary tree, and then run:
 'ctest [-VV] â€“D Experimental'. On Windows, build the EXPERIMENTAL target.

Ctest will build and test the project and submit results to the Kitware public
dashboard. The results of your dashboard will be uploaded to Kitware's public
dashboard here: https://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=CMakeTutorial.
