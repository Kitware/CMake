CheckFortranSourceCompiles
--------------------------

.. versionadded:: 3.1

Check if given Fortran source compiles and links into an executable.

.. command:: check_fortran_source_compiles

  .. code-block:: cmake

    check_fortran_source_compiles(<code> <resultVar>
        [FAIL_REGEX <regex>...]
        [SRC_EXT <extension>]
    )

  Checks that the source supplied in ``<code>`` can be compiled as a Fortran
  source file and linked as an executable. The ``<code>`` must be a Fortran
  ``program``.

  .. code-block:: cmake

    check_fortran_source_compiles("program test
    error stop
    end program"
    HAVE_ERROR_STOP
    SRC_EXT .F90)

  This command can help avoid costly build processes when a compiler lacks support
  for a necessary feature, or a particular vendor library is not compatible with
  the Fortran compiler version being used. This generate-time check may advise the
  user of such before the main build process. See also the
  :command:`check_fortran_source_runs` command to run the compiled code.

  The result will be stored in the internal cache
  variable ``<resultVar>``, with a boolean true value for success and boolean
  false for failure.

  If ``FAIL_REGEX`` is provided, then failure is determined by checking
  if anything in the output matches any of the specified regular expressions.

  By default, the test source file will be given a ``.F`` file extension. The
  ``SRC_EXT`` option can be used to override this with ``.<extension>`` instead--
  ``.F90`` is a typical choice.

  The check is only performed once, with the result cached in the variable named
  by ``<resultVar>``. Every subsequent CMake run will re-use this cached value
  rather than performing the check again, even if the ``<code>`` changes. In
  order to force the check to be re-evaluated, the variable named by
  ``<resultVar>`` must be manually removed from the cache.

  The compile and link commands can be influenced by setting any of the
  following variables prior to calling ``check_fortran_source_compiles()``:

.. include:: /module/CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS.txt

.. include:: /module/CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS.txt

.. include:: /module/CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES.txt

.. include:: /module/CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS.txt

.. include:: /module/CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES.txt

.. include:: /module/CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET.txt
