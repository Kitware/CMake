# - Locate FreeType library
# This module defines
#  FREETYPE_LIBRARIES, the library to link against
#  FREETYPE_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to FREETYPE
#  FREETYPE_INCLUDE_DIRS, where to find headers.
#  This is the concatenation of the paths:
#  FREETYPE_INCLUDE_DIR_ft2build
#  FREETYPE_INCLUDE_DIR_freetype2
#
# $FREETYPE_DIR is an environment variable that would
# correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$FREETYPE_DIR
# used in building FREETYPE.

# Ugh, FreeType seems to use some #include trickery which
# makes this harder than it should be. It looks like they
# put ft2build.h in a common/easier-to-find location which
# then contains a #include to a more specific header in a
# more specific location (#include <freetype/config/ftheader.h>).
# Then from there, they need to set a bunch of #define's
# so you can do something like:
# #include FT_FREETYPE_H
# Unfortunately, using CMake's mechanisms like INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES()
# wants explicit full paths and this trickery doesn't work too well.
# I'm going to attempt to cut out the middleman and hope
# everything still works.
