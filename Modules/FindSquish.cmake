# ---- Find Squish
# This module can be used to find Squish (currently support is aimed at version 3).

# ---- Variables and Macros
#  SQUISH_FOUND                    If false, don't try to use Squish
#
#  SQUISH_INSTALL_DIR              The Squish installation directory (containing bin, lib, etc)
#  SQUISH_SERVER_EXECUTABLE        The squishserver executable
#  SQUISH_CLIENT_EXECUTABLE        The squishrunner executable
#
#  SQUISH_INSTALL_DIR_FOUND        Was the install directory found?
#  SQUISH_SERVER_EXECUTABLE_FOUND  Was the server executable found?
#  SQUISH_CLIENT_EXECUTABLE_FOUND  Was the client executable found?
