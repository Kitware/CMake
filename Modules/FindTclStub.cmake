# - Find Tcl stub libraries.
# This module finds Tcl stub libraries. It first finds Tcl include files and
# libraries by calling FindTCL.cmake.
# How to Use the Tcl Stubs Library:
#   http://tcl.activestate.com/doc/howto/stubs.html
# Using Stub Libraries:
#   http://safari.oreilly.com/0130385603/ch48lev1sec3
# This code sets the following variables:
#  TCL_STUB_LIBRARY       = path to Tcl stub library
#  TK_STUB_LIBRARY        = path to Tk stub library
#  TTK_STUB_LIBRARY       = path to ttk stub library
#
# In an effort to remove some clutter and clear up some issues for people
# who are not necessarily Tcl/Tk gurus/developpers, some variables were
# moved or removed. Changes compared to CMake 2.4 are:
# - TCL_STUB_LIBRARY_DEBUG and TK_STUB_LIBRARY_DEBUG were removed.
#   => these libs are not packaged by default with Tcl/Tk distributions. 
#      Even when Tcl/Tk is built from source, several flavors of debug libs
#      are created and there is no real reason to pick a single one
#      specifically (say, amongst tclstub84g, tclstub84gs, or tclstub84sgx). 
#      Let's leave that choice to the user by allowing him to assign 
#      TCL_STUB_LIBRARY to any Tcl library, debug or not.
