# select_library_configurations( basename )
#
# This macro takes a library base name as an argument, and will choose good
# values for basename_LIBRARY, basename_LIBRARIES, basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG, and
# basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE depending on what has been found and set.  If only
# basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE is defined, basename_LIBRARY, basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG,
# and basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE will be set to the release value.  If only
# basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG is defined, then basename_LIBRARY,
# basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG and basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE will take the debug value.
#
# If the generator supports configuration types, then basename_LIBRARY and
# basename_LIBRARIES will be set with debug and optimized flags specifying the
# library to be used for the given configuration.  If no build type has been set
# or the generator in use does not support configuration types, then
# basename_LIBRARY and basename_LIBRARIES will take only the release values.
