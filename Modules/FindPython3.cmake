FindPython3
-----------

Find Python 3 interpreter, compiler and development environment (include
directories and libraries).

Three components are supported:

* ``Interpreter``: search for Python 3 interpreter
* ``Compiler``: search for Python 3 compiler. Only offered by IronPython.
* ``Development``: search for development artifacts (include directories and
  libraries)
* ``NumPy``: search for NumPy include directories.

If no ``COMPONENTS`` is specified, ``Interpreter`` is assumed.

To ensure consistent versions between components ``Interpreter``, ``Compiler``,
``Development`` and ``NumPy``, specify all components at the same time::

  find_package (Python3 COMPONENTS Interpreter Development)

This module looks only for version 3 of Python. This module can be used
concurrently with :module:`FindPython2` module to use both Python versions.

The :module:`FindPython` module can be used if Python version does not matter
for you.

.. note::

  If components ``Interpreter`` and ``Development`` are both specified, this
  module search only for interpreter with same platform architecture as the one
  defined by ``CMake`` configuration. This contraint does not apply if only
  ``Interpreter`` component is specified.

Imported Targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module defines the following :ref:`Imported Targets <Imported Targets>`
(when :prop_gbl:`CMAKE_ROLE` is ``PROJECT``):

``Python3::Interpreter``

  ``Development`` is found.

  ``Development`` is found.
``Python3::NumPy``

Hints
^^^^^

``Python3_ROOT_DIR``
  Define the root directory of a Python 3 installation.

``Python3_USE_STATIC_LIBS``
  * If not defined, search for shared libraries and static libraries in that
    order.
  * If set to TRUE, search **only** for static libraries.
  * If set to FALSE, search **only** for shared libraries.

``Python3_FIND_ABI``
  This variable defines which ABIs, as defined in
  `PEP 3149 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3149/>`_, should be searched.

  .. note::

    If ``Python3_FIND_ABI`` is not defined, any ABI will be searched.

  The ``Python3_FIND_ABI`` variable is a 3-tuple specifying, in that order,
  ``pydebug`` (``d``), ``pymalloc`` (``m``) and ``unicode`` (``u``) flags.
  Each element can be set to one of the following:

  * ``ON``: Corresponding flag is selected.
  * ``OFF``: Corresponding flag is not selected.
  * ``ANY``: The two posibilties (``ON`` and ``OFF``) will be searched.

  From this 3-tuple, various ABIs will be searched starting from the most
  specialized to the most general. Moreover, ``debug`` versions will be
  searched **after** ``non-debug`` ones.

  For example, if we have::

    set (Python3_FIND_ABI "ON" "ANY" "ANY")

  The following flags combinations will be appended, in that order, to the
  artifact names: ``dmu``, ``dm``, ``du``, and ``d``.

  And to search any possible ABIs::

    set (Python3_FIND_ABI "ANY" "ANY" "ANY")

  The following combinations, in that order, will be used: ``mu``, ``m``,
  ``u``, ``<empty>``, ``dmu``, ``dm``, ``du`` and ``d``.

  .. note::

    This hint is useful only on ``POSIX`` systems. So, on ``Windows`` systems,
    when ``Python3_FIND_ABI`` is defined, ``Python`` distributions from
    `python.org <https://www.python.org/>`_ will be found only if value for
    each flag is ``OFF`` or ``ANY``.

``Python3_FIND_STRATEGY``
  This variable defines how lookup will be done.
  The ``Python3_FIND_STRATEGY`` variable can be set to empty or one of the
  following:

  * ``VERSION``: Try to find the most recent version in all specified
    locations.
    This is the default if policy :policy:`CMP0094` is undefined or set to
    ``OLD``.
  * ``LOCATION``: Stops lookup as soon as a version satisfying version
    constraints is founded.
    This is the default if policy :policy:`CMP0094` is set to ``NEW``.

``Python3_FIND_REGISTRY``
  On Windows the ``Python3_FIND_REGISTRY`` variable determine the order
  of preference between registry and environment variables.
  The ``Python3_FIND_REGISTRY`` variable can be set to empty or one of the
  following:

  * ``FIRST``: Try to use registry before environment variables.
    This is the default.
  * ``LAST``: Try to use registry after environment variables.
  * ``NEVER``: Never try to use registry.

``Python3_FIND_FRAMEWORK``
  On macOS the ``Python3_FIND_FRAMEWORK`` variable determine the order of
  preference between Apple-style and unix-style package components.
  This variable can be set to empty or take same values as
  :variable:`CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK` variable.

  .. note::

    Value ``ONLY`` is not supported so ``FIRST`` will be used instead.

  If ``Python3_FIND_FRAMEWORK`` is not defined, :variable:`CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK`
  variable will be used, if any.

``Python3_FIND_VIRTUALENV``
  This variable defines the handling of virtual environments. It is meaningfull
  only when a virtual environment is active (i.e. the ``activate`` script has
  been evaluated). In this case, it takes precedence over
  ``Python3_FIND_REGISTRY`` and ``CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK`` variables.
  The ``Python3_FIND_VIRTUALENV`` variable can be set to empty or one of the
  following:

  * ``FIRST``: The virtual environment is used before any other standard
    paths to look-up for the interpreter. This is the default.
  * ``ONLY``: Only the virtual environment is used to look-up for the
    interpreter.
  * ``STANDARD``: The virtual environment is not used to look-up for the
    interpreter. In this case, variable ``Python3_FIND_REGISTRY`` (Windows)
    or ``CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK`` (macOS) can be set with value ``LAST`` or
    ``NEVER`` to select preferably the interpreter from the virtual
    environment.

  .. note::

    If the component ``Development`` is requested, it is **strongly**
    recommended to also include the component ``Interpreter`` to get expected
    result.

Artifacts Specification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To solve special cases, it is possible to specify directly the artifacts by
setting the following variables:

``Python3_EXECUTABLE``
  The path to the interpreter.

``Python3_COMPILER``
  The path to the compiler.

``Python3_LIBRARY``
  The path to the library. It will be used to compute the
  variables ``Python3_LIBRARIES``, ``Python3_LIBRAY_DIRS`` and
  ``Python3_RUNTIME_LIBRARY_DIRS``.

``Python3_INCLUDE_DIR``
  The path to the directory of the ``Python`` headers. It will be used to
  compute the variable ``Python3_INCLUDE_DIRS``.

``Python3_NumPy_INCLUDE_DIR``
  The path to the directory of the ``NumPy`` headers. It will be used to
  compute the variable ``Python3_NumPy_INCLUDE_DIRS``.

.. note::

  All paths must be absolute. Any artifact specified with a relative path
  will be ignored.

.. note::

  When an artifact is specified, all ``HINTS`` will be ignored and no search
  will be performed for this artifact.

  If more than one artifact is specified, it is the user's responsability to
  ensure the consistency of the various artifacts.

Commands
^^^^^^^^

This module defines the command ``Python_add_library`` (when
:prop_gbl:`CMAKE_ROLE` is ``PROJECT``), which has the same semantics as
:command:`add_library` and adds a dependency to target ``Python3::Python`` or,
when library type is ``MODULE``, to target ``Python3::Module`` and takes care
of Python module naming rules::

  Python3_add_library (my_module MODULE src1.cpp)

If library type is not specified, ``MODULE`` is assumed.
