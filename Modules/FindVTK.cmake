# - Find a VTK installation or build tree.
# The following variables are set if VTK is found.  If VTK is not
# found, VTK_FOUND is set to false.
#  VTK_FOUND         - Set to true when VTK is found.
#  VTK_USE_FILE      - CMake file to use VTK.
#  VTK_MAJOR_VERSION - The VTK major version number.
#  VTK_MINOR_VERSION - The VTK minor version number
#                       (odd non-release).
#  VTK_BUILD_VERSION - The VTK patch level
#                       (meaningless for odd minor).
#  VTK_INCLUDE_DIRS  - Include directories for VTK
#  VTK_LIBRARY_DIRS  - Link directories for VTK libraries
#  VTK_KITS          - List of VTK kits, in CAPS
#                      (COMMON,IO,) etc.
#  VTK_LANGUAGES     - List of wrapped languages, in CAPS
#                      (TCL, PYHTON,) etc.
# The following cache entries must be set by the user to locate VTK:
#  VTK_DIR  - The directory containing VTKConfig.cmake.
#             This is either the root of the build tree,
#             or the lib/vtk directory.  This is the
#             only cache entry.
# The following variables are set for backward compatibility and
# should not be used in new code:
#  USE_VTK_FILE - The full path to the UseVTK.cmake file.
#                 This is provided for backward
#                 compatibility.  Use VTK_USE_FILE
#                 instead.
