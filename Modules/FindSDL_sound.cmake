# Locates the SDL_sound library

# This module depends on SDL being found and 
# must be called AFTER FindSDL.cmake is called.

# This module defines
# SDL_SOUND_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find SDL_sound.h
# SDL_SOUND_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SDL
# SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES, this contains the list of libraries that you need 
# to link against. This is a read-only variable and is marked INTERNAL.
# SDL_SOUND_EXTRAS, this is an optional variable for you to add your own
# flags to SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES. This is prepended to SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES.
# This is available mostly for cases this module failed to anticipate for
# and you must add additional flags. This is marked as ADVANCED.
 
#
# This module also defines (but you shouldn't need to use directly)
# SDL_SOUND_LIBRARY, the name of just the SDL_sound library you would link
# against. Use SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES for you link instructions and not this one.
# And might define the following as needed
# MIKMOD_LIBRARY
# MODPLUG_LIBRARY
# OGG_LIBRARY
# VORBIS_LIBRARY
# SMPEG_LIBRARY
# FLAC_LIBRARY
# SPEEX_LIBRARY
#
# Typically, you should not use these variables directly, and you should use 
# SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES which contains SDL_SOUND_LIBRARY and the other audio libraries 
# (if needed) to successfully compile on your system . 
#
# Created by Eric Wing. 
# This module is a bit more complicated than the other FindSDL* family modules.
# The reason is that SDL_sound can be compiled in a large variety of different ways
# which are independent of platform. SDL_sound may dynamically link against other 3rd
# party libraries to get additional codec support, such as Ogg Vorbis, SMPEG, ModPlug,
# MikMod, FLAC, Speex, and potentially others. 
# Under some circumstances which I don't fully understand, 
# there seems to be a requirement
# that dependent libraries of libraries you use must also be explicitly 
# linked against in order to successfully compile. SDL_sound does not currently 
# have any system in place to know how it was compiled.
# So this CMake module does the hard work in trying to discover which 3rd party 
# libraries are required for building (if any).
# This module uses a brute force approach to create a test program that uses SDL_sound,
# and then tries to build it. If the build fails, it parses the error output for 
# known symbol names to figure out which libraries are needed.
#
# Responds to the $SDLDIR and $SDLSOUNDDIR environmental variable that would
# correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR used in building SDL.
#
# On OSX, this will prefer the Framework version (if found) over others.
# People will have to manually change the cache values of 
# SDL_LIBRARY to override this selectionor set the CMake environment
# CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH to modify the search paths.

  # CMake is giving me problems using TRY_COMPILE with the CMAKE_FLAGS

  # because it does just that. When I feed this variable to the command,
