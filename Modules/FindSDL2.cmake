# FindSDL2
# -------
#
# Locate SDL2 library
#
# This module defines
#
# ::
#
#   SDL2_LIBRARY, the name of the library to link against
#   SDL2_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SDL
#   SDL2_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find SDL.h
#   SDL2_VERSION_STRING, human-readable string containing the version of SDL
#
#
#
# This module responds to the flag:
#
# ::
#
#   SDL2_BUILDING_LIBRARY
#     If this is defined, then no SDL_main will be linked in because
#     only applications need main().
#     Otherwise, it is assumed you are building an application and this
#     module will attempt to locate and set the proper link flags
#     as part of the returned SDL_LIBRARY variable.
#
#
#
# Don't forget to include SDLmain.h and SDLmain.m your project for the
# OS X framework based version.  (Other versions link to -lSDLmain which
# this module will try to find on your behalf.) Also for OS X, this
# module will automatically add the -framework Cocoa on your behalf.
#
#
#
# Additional Note: If you see an empty SDL2_LIBRARY_TEMP in your
# configuration and no SDL2_LIBRARY, it means CMake did not find your SDL
# library (SDL2.dll, libsdl2.so, SDL2.framework, etc).  Set
# SDL2_LIBRARY_TEMP to point to your SDL2 library, and configure again.
# Similarly, if you see an empty SDL2MAIN_LIBRARY, you should set this
# value as appropriate.  These values are used to generate the final
# SDL2_LIBRARY variable, but when these values are unset, SDL2_LIBRARY
# does not get created.
#
#
#
# $SDL2DIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the
# ./configure --prefix=$SDL2DIR used in building SDL2.  l.e.galup 9-20-02
#
# On OSX, this will prefer the Framework version (if found) over others.
# People will have to manually change the cache values of SDL2_LIBRARY to
# override this selection or set the CMake environment
# CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH to modify the search paths.
#
# Note that the header path has changed from SDL2/SDL.h to just SDL.h
# This needed to change because "proper" SDL convention is #include
# "SDL.h", not <SDL2/SDL.h>.  This is done for portability reasons
# because not all systems place things in SDL/ (see FreeBSD).
