# - Find Tcl includes and libraries.
# This module finds if Tcl is installed and determines where the
# include files and libraries are. It also determines what the name of
# the library is. This code sets the following variables:
#  TCL_FOUND              = Tcl was found
#  TK_FOUND               = Tk was found
#  TCLTK_FOUND            = Tcl and Tk were found
#  TCL_LIBRARY            = path to Tcl library (tcl tcl80)
#  TCL_INCLUDE_PATH       = path to where tcl.h can be found
#  TCL_TCLSH              = path to tclsh binary (tcl tcl80)
#  TK_LIBRARY             = path to Tk library (tk tk80 etc)
#  TK_INCLUDE_PATH        = path to where tk.h can be found
#  TK_WISH                = full path to the wish executable
#
# In an effort to remove some clutter and clear up some issues for people
# who are not necessarily Tcl/Tk gurus/developpers, some variables were
# moved or removed. Changes compared to CMake 2.4 are:
# - The stub libraries are now found in FindTclStub.cmake
#   => they were only useful for people writing Tcl/Tk extensions.
# - TCL_LIBRARY_DEBUG and TK_LIBRARY_DEBUG were removed.
#   => these libs are not packaged by default with Tcl/Tk distributions. 
#      Even when Tcl/Tk is built from source, several flavors of debug libs
#      are created and there is no real reason to pick a single one
#      specifically (say, amongst tcl84g, tcl84gs, or tcl84sgx). 
#      Let's leave that choice to the user by allowing him to assign 
#      TCL_LIBRARY to any Tcl library, debug or not.
# - TK_INTERNAL_PATH was removed.
#   => this ended up being only a Win32 variable, and there is a lot of
#      confusion regarding the location of this file in an installed Tcl/Tk
#      tree anyway (see 8.5 for example). If you need the internal path at
#      this point it is safer you ask directly where the *source* tree is
#      and dig from there.
