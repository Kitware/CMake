                           === RHash program ===

RHash is a console utility for calculation  and verification of magnet links
and a wide range of hash sums like  CRC32,  MD4, MD5,  SHA1, SHA256, SHA512,
SHA3,   AICH,  ED2K,  Tiger,  DC++ TTH,  BitTorrent BTIH,   GOST R 34.11-94,
RIPEMD-160, HAS-160, EDON-R, Whirlpool and Snefru.

Hash sums are used to  ensure and verify integrity  of large volumes of data
for a long-term storing or transferring.

Features:
 * Output in a predefined (SFV, BSD-like) or a user-defined format.
 * Can calculate Magnet links.
 * Updating hash files (adding hash sums of files missing in the hash file).
 * Calculates several hash sums in one pass
 * Ability to process directories recursively.
 * Portability: the program works the same on Linux, *BSD or Windows.


                        === The LibRHash library ===

LibRHash is a professional,  portable,  thread-safe  C library for computing
a wide variety of hash sums, such as  CRC32, MD4, MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512,
SHA3,   AICH,  ED2K,  Tiger,  DC++ TTH,  BitTorrent BTIH,   GOST R 34.11-94,
RIPEMD-160, HAS-160, EDON-R, Whirlpool and Snefru.
Hash sums are used  to ensure and verify integrity of  large volumes of data
for a long-term storing or transferring.

Features:
 * Small and easy to learn interface.
 * Hi-level and Low-level API.
 * Allows calculating of several hash functions simultaneously.
 * Portability: the library works on Linux, *BSD and Windows.
