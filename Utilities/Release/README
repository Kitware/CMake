To create a cmake release, first test the branch:

mkdir 2-4
cd 2-4
cmake -DCMAKE_CREATE_VERSION=CMake-2-4 -P ../create-cmake-release.cmake
./create-CMake-2-4.sh

If that works:
EDIT CMakeLists.txt and remove the RC setting!
commit that.

Then tag the minor release:
cvs tag 2-4-7

Then create a release from the tag:
mkdir 2-4-7
cd 2-4-7
cmake -DCMAKE_CREATE_VERSION=CMake-2-4-7 -P ../create-cmake-release.cmake
./create-CMake-2-4.sh
