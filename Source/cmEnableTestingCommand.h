 * called CMakeTestfile with a syntax similar to CMakeLists.txt.  It contains
 * the SUBDIRS() and ADD_TEST() commands from the source CMakeLists.txt
 * file with CMake variables expanded.  Only the subdirs and tests
 * within the valid control structures are replicated in Testfile
 * (i.e. SUBDIRS() and ADD_TEST() commands within IF() commands that are
 * not entered by CMake are not replicated in Testfile).
 * Note that CTest expects to find this file in the build directory root;
 * therefore, this command should be in the source directory root too.
